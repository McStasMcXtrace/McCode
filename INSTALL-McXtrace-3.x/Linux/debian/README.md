## Install McXtrace 3.2 On Debian class systems (including Ubuntu, mint etc.):
The packages have been tested to work correctly on Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian 11.

# Add the McCode repository
After following the below steps your package manager should now be aware of mcxtrace
```bash
cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
sudo wget http://packages.mccode.org/debian/mccode.list
sudo apt-get update
```

# Debian only:
On Debian you will further have to install the non-free repository to have access to all McXtrace tool parts. See https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList

# The easiest way:
The meta-package *mcxtrace-suite-python-ng* will allow you to install mcxtrace with the recommended set of python-tools (mcrun/mcplot etc.) by a simple apt-get command like
```bash
sudo apt-get install mcxtrace-suite-python-ng
```
The -suite packages without 'ng' in the package name will install the
latest McXtrace 1.x package

# Look for McXtrace packages to install
```bash
mcxtrace@debian:~$ apt-cache search mcxtrace | grep 3.2

# Using mxdoc on modern Ubuntu systems
Ubuntu is shipping its browsers as "snap" packages, meaning that they
are blocked from accessing e.g. the McStas html snippets in
/usr/share/mcxtrace/3.2/.

To fix this we propose to switch your browser to a proper apt based
installation, in this example firefox:

Remove the snap-based firefox:
```
sudo snap remove firefox
```
Add the official mozilla-built firefox instead:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa
```
Set priorities to always prefer this firefox package:
```
echo '
Package: *
Pin: release o=LP-PPA-mozillateam
Pin-Priority: 1001
' | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/mozilla-firefox
```
Set up unattended upgrades of firefox
```
echo 'Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins::
"LP-PPA-mozillateam:${distro_codename}";' | sudo tee
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/51unattended-upgrades-firefox
```
Finally, install firefox from the mozilla-channels
```
sudo apt install firefox
```
