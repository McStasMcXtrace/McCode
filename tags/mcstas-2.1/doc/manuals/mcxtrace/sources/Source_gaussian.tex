\section{Source\_gaussian: the model has a gaussian distribution of intensity}
\label{source-gaussian}
\index{Sources!Source\_gaussian}

A simplified version of a completely incoherent source of horizontal and
vertical sizes \textit{sig\_x} and \textit{sig\_y} respectively with angular divergence
\textit{sigPr\_x} and \textit{sigPr\_y}. Can be used to model an undulator source emitting
a photon beam that has gaussian distribution.
This naturally generates a larger Gaussian profile at a distance. A sampling window at $(0,0,\mathit{dist})$
may be specified by the parameters \textit{focus\_xw} and \textit{focus\_yh}, which restricts the
sampling phases space of the emitted photons (See section~\ref{s:source-pt} for details).

The energy spectrum emitted by \textbf{Source\_gaussian} source is completely analogous to \textbf{Source\_pt}, as is 
its photon phase functionality.
