Tk_StrictMotif - Return value of tk_strictMotif variable

=for category C Programming

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This procedure returns the current value of the B<tk_strictMotif>
variable in the interpreter associated with I<tkwin>'s application.
The value is returned as an integer that is either 0 or 1.
1 means that strict Motif compliance has been requested, so anything
that is not part of the Motif specification should be avoided.
0 means that ``Motif-like'' is good enough, and extra features
are welcome.

This procedure uses a link to the Tcl variable to provide much
faster access to the variable's value than could be had by calling
B<Tcl_GetVar>.

=head1 KEYWORDS
