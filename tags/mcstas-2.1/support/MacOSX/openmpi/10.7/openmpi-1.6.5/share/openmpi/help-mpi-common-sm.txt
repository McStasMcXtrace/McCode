[sys call fail]
A system call failed during shared memory initialization that should
not have.  It is likely that your MPI job will now either abort or
experience performance degradation.

  Local host:  %s
  System call: %s %s
  Error:       %s (errno %d)
#
[mmap too small]
Open MPI requested a shared memory segment that was too small to do
anything useful.  This is likely an error in Open MPI itself.  If you
see this error, you should see if there is an update available for
Open MPI, and if not, contact the Open MPI developers.

  Local host:        %s
  Requested size:    %ul
  Control seg size:  %ul
  Data seg aligment: %ul
#
[mmap on nfs]
WARNING: Open MPI will create a shared memory backing file in a
directory that appears to be mounted on a network filesystem. 
Creating the shared memory backup file on a network file system, such
as NFS or Lustre is not recommended -- it may cause excessive network
traffic to your file servers and/or cause shared memory traffic in
Open MPI to be much slower than expected.

You may want to check what the typical temporary directory is on your
node.  Possible sources of the location of this temporary directory
include the $TEMPDIR, $TEMP, and $TMP environment variables.

Note, too, that system administrators can set a list of filesystems
where Open MPI is disallowed from creating temporary files by settings
the MCA parameter "orte_no_session_dir".

  Local host: %s
  Fileame:    %s
#
[unexpected message id]
Open MPI received an unexpected message ID during common sm initialization.
This is likely an error in Open MPI itself.  If you see this error, you should
see if there is an update available for Open MPI that addresses this issue, and
if not, contact the Open MPI developers.

  Local Host:          %s
  Expected Message ID: %s
  Message ID Received: %s
