McXtrace perl tools for aiding in running X-ray simulations.

McXtrace is a tool for simulating X-ray instrumentation and experiments using a
ray-tracing formalism. Currently the mainuse of McXtrace is in the field of 
synchrotron beamline instrumentation design, but various other uses have been 
found, such as designig X-ray telescopes or for laboratory sources. 

This port contains a few perl-based helper tools (including a GUI) to aid the
user in setting up and running simulations. The tools are:
mxgui: A Tk/Perl based GUI.
mxrun: A Script that makes it easy to run sims and perform
  point scans and simple optimizations.
mxplot: Tool for plotting McXtrace-generated results.
mxdisplay: Visual ray-tracing displaying x-ray phton trajectories.  
mxformatgui: front-end to mxformat to help reformatting data-files (obsolescent).
mxdaemon: deamon to dynamically monitor and plot incoming results (obsolescent).
