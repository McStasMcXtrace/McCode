20050206, code for setting up editors for McStas syntax highlighting

NEDIT:
nedit should be copied to a .nedit file in your home directory

KATE:
mcstas.xml is for usage with the excellent kate editor of KDE. Copy the 
file to e.g. /usr/share/apps/katepart/syntax/ (Correct path on a Debian 
testing system)

(X)EMACS:
McStas is not C only, but quite close. The contents of the provided emacs
file should be entered in your .emacs file, setting font-lock-mode by
default and using the standard c-mode for McStas .instr files.
Note: Works also on Win32, copy the .emacs file to c:\ :-)
