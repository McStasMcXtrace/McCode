A pretty pointless extension which makes
->ImageBackground method available.

As nearly all Tk widgets draw in off-screen Pixmap
about only use is for bits of Frames not obscured by sub-windows.

(I had hoped to use it for HTML3's background attribute...)

It serves as an example of how an Extension can be built after Tk
is installed.
