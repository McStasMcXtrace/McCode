Tk-804.027-p4.patch.gz (2006-11-26)
----------------------

Compiles and passes tests on

  FreeBSD 6.1 + perl5.8.8 + fontconfig 2.3.2
  FreeBSD 6.1 + bleadperl + fontconfig 2.3.2
  Linux Debian + perl5.8.8 + fontconfig 2.4.1
  Solaris 8 + gcc-4.0.3 + perl-5.8.8 + fontconfig-2.4.1 (with two test

I also had success with compiling under recent cygwin using the x11
libraries a few days earlier.

Fixes
  XFT works now with recent fontconfig, no core dumps anymore.

  Fix for segfault in t/regexp.t with perl 5.9.x. See also
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-02/msg00748.html
  for a similar issue.

  Workaround for core dumps when using -font=>undef.

  Fixed wrong usage of $#{@...} which does not work anymore in
  bleadperl.

  Fixed Tk::Text movements wordstart and wordend in unicode content.

  Better handling of undef in BrowseEntry widgets. Bug reported by

Tk-804.027-p3.patch.gz (2006-11-20)
----------------------

Compiles and passes tests on

  FreeBSD 6.1 + perl5.8.8 + xorg 6.9.x + various window managers (fvwm2, twm, metacity ...)
  Linux RedHat 8.0 + perl5.8.0 (one test failure in leak.t)
  Linux RedHat 8.0 + perl5.8.7
  MSWin32 + Strawberry Perl (5.8.8)

There are some test failures with bleedperl, most of them
Tie::Watch-related, which will be fixed in a next version of the
patch.

Incompatible changes
  Return values of some Tk::Wm methods (e.g. aspect, wmGrid,
  iconposition, resizable ...) were changed from returning tclish
  lists (e.g. "1 2 3 4") to perlish lists (1,2,3,4). I believe the
  return values of these methods are rarely used.

  Tk::Wm::wmTracing needs argument for setting on/off, without
  argument just return the current value.

New features
  The newest tkUnixWm.c from Tcl/Tk is now in the Perl/Tk code. This
  adds (experimental?) support for wm attributes -topmost, -zoomed,
  -fullscreen and other _NET_WM features (iconphoto) under Unix/X11.

  Tk::Wm::stackorder was missing in Perl/Tk.

  widget demonstration has a Ctrl-Q key binding.

  ptksh: x is an alias for d (like in the perl debugger).
  ptksh: use bold font for prompt.

  Tk::Text: pasting selection with middle mouse sets cursor position now.
  This is consistent with behaviour in other toolkits.

  Tk::Widget: translated UnderlineAmpersand etc. functions.

  Tk::MsgBox: again in Tk, completely new translation from the Tcl/Tk
  original. Looks nicer and behaves better than messageBox through
  Tk::DialogBox.

Fixes
  Fixed crashes of Perl/Tk applications when Gtk/Gnome applications
  were started. See http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16053

  ptksh is not slow anymore when popping up history.
  ptksh: use fixed font for text area.

  Tk::FBox may handle paths with high-bit set.

  Image and bitmap filenames with high-bit set work now. See
  http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.tk/msg/865b56226af23f7c

  Minor Tk::TextList fixes, but still most tests fail.

  Fixed some menu problems, see
  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=15677,
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=6166

  Title of tearoff menus now set correctly.

  ptked may be started without initial filename.

  gedi works again.
  
  Fixed some core dumps.

  Tk::Listbox insert/delete does not leak memory anymore (well, not
  that much). See
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=12466

  Building on RedHat systems works now, see
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=6708

  Tk::NoteBook fix for pages method, see
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8567

  Tk::Canvas fix for -state => hidden issue, see
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=4677

Documentation
  Tk::Widget::Walk is now documented.

  Corrected installation path for Tk::Menu::Item.

  Fixed invalid Pod syntax.

Tests
  Converted some tests from Test to Test::More

  Enable unicode tests where possible.

  Make all tests working with XFT=1.

  New tests, converted from the Tcl counterparts: canvas.t, wm-tcl.t,
  text.t (latter not completed yet)

  00wmcheck.t: show user's window manager before starting tests.

  (Almost) no test should request user positioning windows (for old
  window managers like twm).

  Some wm-dependent tests were marked as TODO tests.
