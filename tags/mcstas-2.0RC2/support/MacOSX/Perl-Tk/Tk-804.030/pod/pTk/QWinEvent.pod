Tk_QueueWindowEvent - Add a window event to the Tcl event queue

=for category C Programming

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<#include E<lt>tk.hE<gt>>

B<Tk_QueueWindowEvent>(I<eventPtr, position>)

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item XEvent *eventPtr (in)

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This procedure places a window event on Tcl's
internal event queue for eventual servicing.  It creates a
Tcl_Event structure, copies the event into that structure,
and calls B<Tcl_QueueEvent> to add the event to the queue.
When the event is eventually removed from the queue it is
processed just like all window events.

The I<position> argument to B<Tk_QueueWindowEvent> has
the same significance as for B<Tcl_QueueEvent>;  see the
documentation for B<Tcl_QueueEvent> for details.
