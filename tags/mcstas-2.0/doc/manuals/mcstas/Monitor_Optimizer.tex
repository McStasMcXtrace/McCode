\section{Monitor\_Optimizer: Optimization locations for the\\
  Source\_Optimizer}
\label{monitor-optimizer}
\index{Sources!Optimization location|see{Sources/Optimizer}}\index{Optimization}
\component{Source\_Optimizer}{E. Farhi, ILL}{optim\_comp}{$x_{min}$, $x_{max}$, $y_{min}$,$y_{max}$}{partially validated}

The {\bf Monitor\_Optimizer} component works with the {\bf
  Source\_Optimizer} component. See section~\ref{source-optimizer}
for usage.

The input parameters for {\bf Monitor\_Optimizer} are the rectangular
shaped opening coordinates $x_{min}$, $x_{max}$, $y_{min}$,
$y_{max}$, and the name of the associated instance of
{\bf Source\_Optimizer} used in the instrument description file (one word,
without quotes).

As many Monitor\_Optimizer instances as required may be used in an instrument, 
for possibly more than one optimization location. 
Multiple instances may all have an effect on the total intensity.
