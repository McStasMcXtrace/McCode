Up to date information on installation procedures on the various supported
platforms are available under the installation heading on the \MCX project
webpage: http://www.mcxtrace.org

\subsection{Platform support}
McXtrace is a multiplatform effort. The team policy is to supply native style installation packages
for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[Mac OS X] The aim is to supply installation packages for the 3 latest releases.
  \item[Windows] We make packages as ling as the system is supported by Microsoft.
  \item[Linux] .deb based distributions.
  \item[Linux] .rpm based distributions.
  \item[FreeBSD] Through the ports system.
\end{itemize}
Plus probably any UNIX/POSIX type environment with a bit of effort, using the source distribution of \MCX.

The team will be happy to make package builds for other types of systems on
request. Please write to the user mailing list
\texttt{mcxtrace-users@mcxtrace.org} to request a special build.
