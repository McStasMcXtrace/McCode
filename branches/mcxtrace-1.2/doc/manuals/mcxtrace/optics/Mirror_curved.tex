\section{Mirror\_curved: Cylindrically curved mirror}
\index{Optics!mirror}

\mcdoccomp{optics/Mirror_curved.parms}

Models a cylindrical mirror, positioned in the XZ-plane curving towards
positive X. The input parameter \textit{radius} defines the radius of curvature
and the mirror size is given by \textit{length} and \textit{width} where length
and width is along Z and Y respectively. \textit{coating} and \textit{R0} are mutually
exclusive. If \textit{R0} is nonzero, it is taken as the reflectivity value,
irrespective of wavelength, whereas coating nominates a file from which to read
values for $f_1$ and $f_2$. See~\cite{NIST-ffast} for definitions. For
elements $Z\in[1,92]$ datafiles are distributed with the McXtrace system that
may be used as: \verb+coating="Rh.txt"+. or \verb+coating="Al.txt"+. 

This component is scheduled to be merged with \texttt{Mirror\_parabolic} and \texttt{Mirror\_elliptic}
