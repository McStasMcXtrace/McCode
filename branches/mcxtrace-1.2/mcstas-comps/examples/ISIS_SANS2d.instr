*         McStas instrument definition URL=http://www.mcstas.org
*
* Instrument: ISIS_SANS2d 
*
* %Identification
* Written by: Richard Heenan with edits by Peter Willendrup
* Date: 2014
* Origin: ISIS, DTU Fysik
* Release: McStas 2.x
* Version: 0.2
* %INSTRUMENT_SITE: ISIS
*
* This instrument models the ISIS TS2 SANS2d instrument.
*
* %Description
* This instrument models the ISIS TS2 SANS2d instrument up to the sample position.
*
* From the author:
* <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> The instrument model does not currently include a correct moderator description 
* - and the results it produces have not been validated against experimental results.
* <p>The actual bender is continuously curved, here use straight segments approx.with gravity.
* 1/7/10 L1=4m  increased gap between bender exit and S1 slit from .247 to .286m
* At 4m we actually use 1.75 to 16.5 angstrom. 
* <p>Note "2m guides" are actually 1.985m long (new ones will be 1.981m) so "real gaps" are included below, losses are pro-rata the gap/guide lengths.
* <p>Both rear & front detectors are 980mm square and offset 150 above beam (would only use 100mm with hindsight) 
* <p>Rear detector can be offset -300mm or +269mm sideways.
* <p>Front detector is closest at approx 1.4m,  furthest at approx((read det position) - 1.6m) , offset  up to -1200mm sideways 
* there are 2 baffles between front & rear detector
* <p>NIMROD (W5) spectrum might better than SANS2d (E2) spectrum for liquid H2 face incurent use.
* Stu Ansell's McStas spectra for TS-2 actually have no angle variation included.
* In reality spectra and backgrounds will vary, fast background is likely much higher on ZOOM(E1) than SANS2d (E2)
* <p>RKH 2014
*
* %Parameters
* L1:  [m] Variable distance from 1st to 2nd variable slit
* S6:  [m] Radius of slit S6 (last of the optis slits)
* A1w: [m] Width of first collimation slit, rectangular slit
* A1h: [m] Height of first collimation slit, rectangular slit
* A2:  [m] Radius of second collimation slit, circular slit
* Lmin: [AA] Minimum wavelength to produce at the source
* Lmax: [AA] Maximum wavelength to produce at the source
