[no-rankfile]
Open RTE was unable to open the rankfile:
    %s
Check to make sure the path and filename are correct.

usage:  mpirun mca rmaps_rankfile_path rankfile ./app

all unspecified by rankfile ranks are assigned using
byslot or bynode policy.

example:  cat hosfile
    host1
    host2
    host3
    host4
          cat rankfile
    rank 1=host1 slot=1:0,1
    rank 0=host2 slot=0:*
    rank 2=host4 slot=1-2
    rank 3=host3 slot=0:1,1:0-2
#
[parse_error_string]
Open RTE detected a parse error in the rankfile (%s)
It occured on line number %d on token %d:
    %s
#
[parse_error_int]
Open RTE detected a parse error in the rankfile (%s)
It occured on line number %d on token %d:
    %d
#
[parse_error]
Open RTE detected a parse error in the rankfile (%s)
It occured on line number %d on token %d.
#
[not-all-mapped-alloc]
Some of the requested ranks are not included in the current allocation.
    %s

Please verify that you have specified the allocated resources properly in
the provided rankfile.
#
[bad-host]
The rankfile that was used claimed that a host was either not
allocated or oversubscribed its slots.  Please review your rank-slot
assignments and your host allocation to ensure a proper match.  Also,
some systems may require using full hostnames, such as
"host1.example.com" (instead of just plain "host1").

  Host: %s
#
[bad-index]
Rankfile claimed host %s by index that is bigger than number of allocated hosts.
#
[orte-rmaps-rf:alloc-error]
There are not enough slots available in the system to satisfy the %d slots
that were requested by the application:
    %s

Either request fewer slots for your application, or make more slots available
for use.
#
[bad-rankfile]
Error, invalid rank (%d) in the rankfile (%s)
#
[bad-assign]
Error, rank %d is already assigned to %s, check %s
#
[bad-syntax]
Error, invalid syntax in the rankfile (%s)
syntax must be the fallowing
rank i=host_i slot=string
ex: rank 1=host1 slot=1:0,1
#
[orte-rmaps-rf:multi-apps-and-zero-np]
RMAPS found multiple applications to be launched, with
at least one that failed to specify the number of processes to execute.
When specifying multiple applications, you must specify how many processes
of each to launch via the -np argument.
#
[orte-rmaps-rf:per-node-and-too-many-procs]
There are not enough nodes in your allocation to satisfy your request to
launch
%d processes on a per-node basis - only %d nodes were available.

Either request fewer processes, or obtain a larger allocation.
#
[orte-rmaps-rf:n-per-node-and-too-many-procs]
There are not enough nodes in your allocation to satisfy your request to
launch
%d processes on a %d per-node basis - only %d nodes with a total of %d slots
%were available.

Either request fewer processes, or obtain a larger allocation.
#
[orte-rmaps-rf:n-per-node-and-not-enough-slots]
There are not enough slots on the nodes in your allocation to satisfy your
request to launch on a %d process-per-node basis - only %d slots/node were
available.

Either request fewer processes/node, or obtain a larger allocation.
#
[not-supported]
The rank_file mapper no longer supports mapping to physical processor ids.
Please express the mapping in terms of logical processors by removing all
'P' or 'p' modifiers.
