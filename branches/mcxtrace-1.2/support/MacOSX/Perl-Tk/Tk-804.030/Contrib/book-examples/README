Hello,

 After reading through the Ousterhout book 'Tcl and the Tk toolkit' I wanted to
excercise a bit and I translated some of the examples. In an appended tar file
there are the examples I've already done. The files are called after the figure
in the book they go with. So the code for Figure 16.2 is called f-16.2pl.
 Some off the examples aren't -w clean, if anyone knows how to solve this feel
free to comment. I wasn't able to get the code which goes with figure 16.3 to
work. If anyone has comments, questions, ... feel free to drop me a line.


Kris,
