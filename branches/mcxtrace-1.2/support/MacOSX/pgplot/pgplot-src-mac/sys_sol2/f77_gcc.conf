# Where to look for any system-specific versions of the files in
# pgplot/sys. Before evaluating this script, makemake sets SYSDIR to
# /wherever/pgplot/sys_$OS, where $OS is the operating-system name
# given by the second command-line argument of makemake. If the
# present configuration is one of many for this OS, and it needs
# different modifications to files in pgplot/sys than the other
# configurations, then you should create a subdirectory of SYSDIR,
# place the modified files in it and change the following line to
# $SYSDIR="$SYSDIR/subdirectory_name".
