This version of PGPLOT has been tested on a Cray running UNICOS
(version 6).  Many of the drivers now compile without modification on
the Cray (such as the PostScript, HPGL, QMS, Tektronix, and VT125) The
/XDISP driver, and all drivers that use %val() for passing addresses
of dynamically-allocated memory [includsing GIF, PPM, etc.], cannot be
compiled.  Avoid use of these drivers.

The following people have contributed to the Cray port:

Allyn Tennant, Jose Navarro, D. L. Meier, Bob Sault.
