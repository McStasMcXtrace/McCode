McXtrace - Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations of X-ray experiments.

McXtrace is a tool for simulating X-ray instrumentation and experiments using a
ray-tracing formalism. Currently the mainuse of McXtrace is in the field of 
synchrotron beamline instrumentation design, but various other uses have been 
found, such as designig X-ray telescopes or for laboratory sources.
