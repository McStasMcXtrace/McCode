Usage: pgbind template [-w ] [-h ] [-suffix string] [-case upper|lower] [-false integer] [-true integer] [files]

 Where template must be one of:
  bsd        BSD f77 template. C string pointers are passed directly, but
             the length of each string is appended as an extra argument to
             the FORTRAN procedure call.
             Default options:  -suffix "_" -case lower -false 0 -true 1
  cray2      Cray-2 FORTRAN template. C string pointers and lengths are
             combined into a single argument with the Cray fortran.h
             _cptofcd(pointer,length) macro.
             Default options:  -suffix "" -case upper -false 0 -true 1
  vms        VMS FORTRAN template. C strings are passed via FORTRAN string
             descriptors.
             Default options:  -suffix "" -case lower -false 0 -true -1
  ms         Microsoft Powerstation Fortran + Visual C++. Each string
             argument is passed to the FORTRAN procedure as two adjacent
             arguments. The first argument is the C char * pointer of the
             string. The second is an int argument that contains the
             length of the string. In addition, the C prototype of the
             FORTRAN function contains a __stdcall qualifier
             Default options:  -suffix "" -case upper -false 0 -true 1

 Options:
  -w                     Write wrapper files.
  -h                     Write a new wrapper-library header file.
  -suffix  string        The suffix appended to FORTRAN symbols by the
                         linker.
  -case    upper|lower   The typographical case given to FORTRAN symbols
                         by the linker.
  -false   integer       The numerical value of FORTRAN .FALSE.
  -true    integer       The numerical value of FORTRAN .TRUE.

Prototype input files:
  files  Each file can contain zero or more C prototypes. Each prototype
         consists of one or more lines, each line marked with C% in
         columns 1-2. Continuation lines are heralded by a '\' character
         at the end of the line being continued.
         If no files are specified, standard input is read.
