----------

Fixed bugs :

- In the plot function, the '2o' property now also changes the size of the marker 
- A xlabel or ylabel caused a clipping and e.g. title produced nothing.
- Pb with global variables (see fig.sci) : must say global twice !
- A surf() (or mesh, or plot3d, ...) in a subwindow (after a call
to subplot) cleared all the window.

06/07/2000 v0.14
----------

Fixed bugs :

- problem of colormap initialization when a window is created with
xset('window,n')

- I fixed the help files for mesh,surf and surfl. The case of
equal sized X,Y,Z was told to be not supported (although the syntax
is mentioned earlier in the file).

25/10/2000 v0.15
----------

Fixed bugs :

- The Y axis did not behave like the X axis, concerning the automatic
labels generations (pretty axis graduation was not activated, and 
the behaviour was as if 'axis','tightY' was systematicaly added). This
is now fixed. 

27/11/2000 v0.16
----------

Fixed bugs (installation step) :

Simon Bridger said :

-  The install didn't work under WIN98, so I made the changes below...
 The main reason is that under windows, the batch file keeps executing
 before any windows programs have finished executing. This means that
 SCILAB.STAR can get replaced, before scilab has executed it...

I have retained his solution.

Other bugs :

- Problem with colormaps. After a colormap(cmap) call then a 
subsequent pcolor(), surf() or other used the previous colormap
(before the colormap call). Fixed

04/07/2001 v0.17b1
------------------

Fixed bugs :

- Better zooming for 2D functions. Now the background of the plot is
correctly displayed when zooming.

18/07/2002 v0.17
----------------

Fixed bugs :

- Behaviour of legends and labels when zooming was
really strange. Now everything remains OK, after a
rewrite of some functions (process2DPrelim.sci,
processLegend.sci, processColorbar.sci, ...)
- Colorbars only appear after a redraw of the window (bug
under Windows) 

18/07/2002 v0.18b1
------------------

Installation bugs have disappeared since the adoption
of the builder.sce/loader.sce system.

10/11/2003 v0.18
------------------

-Problems with b/w export, the background was black (fixed)
-Problem with superposition of previous and current tick
marks and such, when a window got an "expose" event (under unix),
and at anytime (under windows) -> fixed also

There are still redrawing problems (background painting) under
windows for suplot plots under windows, but they are not due
to the Plotlib !
