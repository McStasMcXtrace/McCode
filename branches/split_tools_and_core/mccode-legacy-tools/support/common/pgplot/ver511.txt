PGPLOT version 5.1.1

Tested Systems

Version 5.1.1 has been tested with the following operating systems and
compilers. Drivers tested include: GI, GL, NU, PP, PS, TT, VT, WD, X2, XM,
XW (but not all combinations of drivers and systems have been tested
exhaustively).

   * SunOS 4.1.3_U1, Sun Fortran (f77) 1.3.1, GNU C (gcc) 2.7.0 (tested on
     SPARC 5).
   * Solaris 2.5 (SunOS 5.5), Sun Fortran (f77) 3.0.1, Sun C (cc) 3.0.1
     (tested on SPARC IPX).
   * Solaris 2.5 (SunOS 5.5), Sun Fortran (f77) 3.0.1, GNU C (gcc) 2.7.2
     (tested on SPARC IPX, SPARC Ultra-1).
   * OpenVMS AXP V6.1, DEC FORTRAN V6.2, DEC C V4.0, DECwindows Motif 1.1
     (tested on DEC 3000/M600).
   * OpenVMS VAX V6.1, DEC FORTRAN V6.2, DEC C V4.0, DECwindows Motif 1.2
     (tested on VAXstation 4000-90).

Changes in Version 5.1.1

All changes are bug fixes or minor improvements. The most notable bug fixes
are:

   * PGOPEN, PGBEG: a device specification like '? ' (question mark with one
     or more trailing spaces) causes PGOPEN to issue a blank prompt for
     device specification. This was an unintended change in 5.1.0, and has
     been fixed in version 5.1.1.

   * PGBEG: in version 5.1.0, the ordering of panels changed from row order
     to column order. The way the sign of the NXSUB argument was interpreted
     was precisely the opposite of the documented interpretation (NXSUB > 0
     should give row order, and < 0 should give column order). PGSUBP has
     always been wrong, but PGBEG acquired the incorrect behavior in version
     5.1.0. Both PGBEG and PGSUBP now behave as documented.

   * The PostScript driver was ignoring environment variables used to set
     the paper size. It now recognizes these variables. In addition, it will
     accept requests via routine PGPAP to change the paper size, even if the
     size requested is larger than the default size. (You can still set the
     default size with environment variables PGPLOT_PS_WIDTH and
     PGPLOT_PS_HEIGHT.) There are two side-effects of this change: (1) When
     PGPAP is used, a portrait-mode graph is placed in the lower left corner
     of the paper (offset by the amount specified by environment variables
     PGPLOT_PS_HOFFSET and PGPLOT_PS_VOFFSET; a landscape-mode graph is
     placed in the same corner of the paper, but in this case it appears to
     be the top left corner! (2) When PGPAP is used, the bounding-box cannot
     be guessed when the file is opened, so you should not use the
     PGPLOT_PS_BBOX environment variable; if you do not set this variable, a
     correct bounding box will be written in the file trailer (see the
     discussion in the note on the PostScript printer driver).

List of Changes

pgplot
     aaaread.me
          Revised for version 5.1.1.
     copyright.notice
          Version number changed.
     makemake
          It now issues a message encouraging the installer to read the
          appropriate README file.
     ver511.txt [new file]
          List of changes (this file).
pgplot/drivers
     psdriv.f
          Bug fixes: PGPLOT_PS_HOFFSET and PGPLOT_PS_VOFFSET were not
          decoded correctly (bug introduced in v5.1.0); bounding box could
          be incorrect (probably only on systems with non-static allocation
          of Fortran variables). Driver now honors all requests to change
          the paper size with PGPAP. Optimization: suppressed attempts to
          draw zero-length continuation line segments (thanks to Remko
          Scharroo).
     vtdriv-vms.f
          This is an alternative to vtdriv.f. It uses VMS-specific Fortran,
          but may work better than vtdriv.f on VMS systems.
     xwdriv.c, pgxwin_server.c
          Bug fix: images were displayed incorrectly on (some?) X-servers
          with more than 8 bits per pixel.
pgplot/examples
     pgdemo2.f
          Added example of Cyrillic text on page 3.
pgplot/src
     grdtyp.f, grpars.f
          Bug fix: improved minmatch routine for device types to allow,
          e.g., /HPGL even if /HPGL2 is also an option.
     grpocl.f
          Bug fix: (this is a support routine for polygon fill with PGPOLY,
          etc.) A polygon with one vertex exactly aligned with the edge of
          the window was not clipped correctly (thanks to Remko Scharroo for
          the bug fix).
     pgopen.f
          Bug fix and improvement in header comments. V5.1.0 introduced a
          bug: a device argument of '? ' with one or more trailing spaces
          did not issue the correct prompt.
     pgqinf.f
          Change version to 5.1.1.
     pgsave.f
          Correction in header comments.
     pgsubp.f
          This routine was interpreting a negative NXSUB argument
          incorrectly. According to the documentation, positive NXSUB should
          step through the panels in row order, while negative NXSUB should
          step through them in column order; but the routine was
          interpreting positive NXSUB as column order and negative as row
          order. The behavior has been corrected to match the documentation.
          (In version 5.1.0, pgbeg was changed to call pgsubp, thus
          introducing this bug in pgbeg as well.)
     pgtbox.f
          The positioning of labels relative to the axis has been improved;
          the displacement of labels from the axis should now be the same as
          in PGBOX. Problems were most noticeable when a large character
          size was requested. (Thanks to Neil Killeen for the fix.)
     pgvect.f
          The routine was ignoring the first row and column of the array
          when finding the scale-factor for the vector length. (Thanks to
          David Singleton for pointing this out.)
pgplot/sys_arc
     F77/ACDriver
          Revised to allow a concurrent hardcopy device (Dave Crennell).
     F77/GRexecAC
          Correct typo (Dave Crennell).

     This new directory replaces sys_vp2200. The files are from David
     Singleton.

     aaaread.me
          Added notes about use of Sun f90 compiler and GNU g77 compiler.
          Added note about problem with the ucb version of "ld".
     f90_cc.conf [new file]
          For Solaris f90 1.1 Fortran compiler (from Ricardo Piriz).
     g77_gcc.conf [new file]
          For GNU g77 Fortran compiler (with gcc).

          Includes some notes on incompatibilities between versions of
          Motif, C compiler, and VMS.
     grlgtr.f
          This has been rewritten: it now treats logical names as
          case-insensitive, and uses $TRNLNM instead of obsolete $TRNLOG.
     makedoc.com [new file]
          A DCL command procedure to extract the documentation from the
          source code.
