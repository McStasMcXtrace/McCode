c                                   CurveFit
c
c         A general curve fitting routine using PGPLOT graphics.  It works on
c      VAX/uVAX systems, possibly any system running PGPLOT.
c
c         CurveFit will plot up to 30 data sets (a maximum of 2500 points for
c      each data set, a maximum of 24000 points total for one graph), saved
c      as (xp,yp) in ascending {xp} order.  Different data sets in one file
c      must be separated by one non-numeric line.  CurveFit can also modify the
c      data set, by flipping the x and y axes and/or taking logarithms of
c      either or both of them.  Labels and title can be added to the plots.
c      In addition, CurveFit allows one to fit various types of curves to the
c      data sets.  These are:
c
c           (a)  straight line (connect the dots)
c           (b)  cubic spline
c           (c)  smoothing (Bezier) polynomial
c           (d)  low-pass Fourier transform filter
c           (e)  a best-fit polynomial of up to 10 terms
c
c         CurveFit is menu driven and allows one to display all intermediary
c      results.  The x,y plotting ranges are user determined, as is the
c      fitting range (over the x coordinate).  Each type of fit can only be
c      used once with each data set, though different fits may be used with
c      the same data set (however, one could load the data set in again and do
c      the same fit over a different range).  Different data sets can have
c      different symbols and line styles/widths associated with them, so they
c      can be differentiated.  The manner in which the line styles/widths is
c      determined can be changed if the user so desires, as can the symbols
c      used to plot the data points.  Plots can be made on any device that is
c      supported by PGPLOT.
c
c         The programme is fairly well documented.  A subsantial amount of
c      virtual memory is required (of the order of 7 Mb), but this can be
c      decreased by lowering the number of data points that may be plotted.
c      The following are pseudo-global variables that must be changed in each
c      subroutine in order for the programme to work.
c
c           MAXPOINTS    the maximum number of points allowed per graph
c           MAXPOINTSET  the maximum number of data points per data set
c           MAXDATASET   the maximum number of data sets per graph
c           NCOEFF       the maximum number of coefficients for polynomial
c                            fitting
c           S2           gives the extra number of points calculated by the
c                            curve fitting routines to make the curves look
c                            smooth, given as 4*MAXPOINTS or 8*MAXPOINTS
c
c         The Bezier polynomial fitting is taken from Borland's TURBO Graphix
c      Toolbox (translated into FORTRAN), while the cubic spline routines
c      are partially taken from there, and partially my own algorithm.  The
c      polynomial fitting and the fast Fourier transforms are taken from
c      the book Numerical Recipes by W.H. Press et al.  Except as noted below,
c      the routines all seem to do what they are supposed to.  Note that the
c      polynomial curve fitting gives the coefficients and their standard
c      deviation as well.  Take these values with a grain of salt!
c
c         Currently, everything seems to work fairly well, except for some
c      numerical difficulties with the fast Fourier transform that I am
c      unable to fathom.  The problem only becomes noticeable when the FFT
c      smoothing takes place over more than about 100 data points, when
c      anomalous step functions appear at intervals of powers of 2.  The
c      step functions get larger as more data points are being smoothed over.
c      I would appreciate a solution if anyone comes up with one.
c
c         One other minor difficulty discovered occurs when one is taking
c      logs of more than one data set.  It is possible that the endpoints
c      used for the plotting will not cover the full range of all of the
c      data sets plotted.  A fix would require several more variables, plus
c      thinking, of which I do not have time at the present.
c
c         Distribute and use this programme as you see fit.  If anyone comes
c      up with major changes or improvements, please send me a copy of the
c      source code.  If anyone wishes a current copy, send me a note, and
c      the current source code will be sent out to them.  I can be reached

c
c  October 27, 1987 -     Fix of subroutine Spline1.  It was able to crash
c                     with a particular spacing of {xp}.  It was also found
c                     to be incorrect.
c                         Fix to all calculation subroutines, so that the
c                     fit will be made over only the points INSIDE the
c                     given fit range, inclusively, i.e. no extrapolation.
c  October 28, 1987 -     Fix of Subroutine Spline2.  It gave discontinuous
c                     spikes at the endpoints.
c                         Add double precision calculations to Spline1 and
c                     Spline2 to allow accurate subtractions/additions.
c  November 6, 1987 -     Fix of calculation procedures that give the range
c                     of the plot.  These are now given to 2 digits accuracy.
c                         Add the option to plot or not plot the individual
c                     data points.
c  November 13, 1987 -    Fix the x,y plotting limits when new data sets are
c                     loaded.
c                         Each {xp,yp} pair must be on the same line.  Other
c                     information is now allowed on each line after {xp,yp}.
c  March 8, 1988 -        Add READDATA subroutine, that allows one to:
c                     a) skip lines at the beginning before data input,
c                     b) have up to 25 columns of data that can be accessed,
c                     c) read multiple data sets from the same file.
c  April 21, 1988 -       Fix of number of points associated with the data
c                     set number.
c                         The default video and hardcopy devices are now
c                     /VT and /IM, respectively.
c  May 30, 1988 -         Add the option of user inputed line styles/widths.
c  June 2, 1988 -         Correct the problem of bad standard deviations on the
c                     polynomial coefficients.
c                         Add REAL*8 and /G_FLOATING to all of the polynomial
c                     calculations.
c  June 13, 1988 -        Add some idiot-proofing (read `Error checking') of
c                     the curve-fitting routines.
c  July 27, 1988 -        Correct the assignments of the fitting range
c                     variables.
c  August 29, 1988 -      Add error-trapping of non-character data input.
c                         Add scaling (in x and/or y) of any data set.
c                         Add ability to toggle all line drawing and fits for
c                     any data set at any time.
c                         Add user chosen line style/line width combinations.
c                         Add user chosen data point plot symbols.  The size of
c                     these is regulated by the total number of points (more
c                     points gives smaller symbols).
c  Christmas, 1988 -      Rearrange the storage method for the data.  Now
c                     there is a maximum of 24000 points, or 30 data sets of
c                     2500 points apiece.  This should allow for more
c                     flexibility for the user.
c  June 21, 1989   -      Change the entrance into the routines to allow
c                     multiple changes to data sets without going to the
c                     main menu screen in between each change.
c                         Fix of the log routines.  Check that your machine
c                     will assign 0 to 10^-100.
c  June 22, 1989   -      Fix of number of points plotted for various fits.
c                     Now each fit may have a different number of data points.
c  July 4, 1989    -      Fix of spline calculation routines.  Splines of more
c                     than one dataset were not saved correctly or plotted.
c  July 6, 1989    -      The default line width, line style will now always
c                     be 1 and 1.
c  July 11, 1989   -      Updated the help file subroutine.
c  July 14, 1989   -      Correct the plot symbol choosing routine.
c                         More idiot-proofing.
c                         Add an UpCase function (works with ASCII only).
c  August 29, 1989 -      Change the order of commands so that the main menu
c                     will not automatically be drawn between commands.  To
c                     redraw menu, type in `R' or `M'.
c  August 31, 1989 -      Fix READDATA, so that any data read in will be from
c                     one line only.  Before, multiple lines were permitted.
c                     Also, an error message is given if the asked for column
c                     does not exist.  The column can then be chosen again.
