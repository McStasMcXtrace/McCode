# The NAG f95 FORTRAN compiler and Gnu gcc C compiler.
# Created 23-Dec-98 [RHRZ].
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Optional: Needed by XWDRIV (/xwindow and /xserve) and
#           X2DRIV (/xdisp and /figdisp).
# The arguments needed by the C compiler to locate X-window include files.

   XINCL="-I/usr/X11R6/include"

# Optional: Needed by XMDRIV (/xmotif).
# The arguments needed by the C compiler to locate Motif, Xt and
# X-window include files.

   MOTIF_INCL=""

# Optional: Needed by TKDRIV (/xtk).
# The arguments needed by the C compiler to locate Tcl, Tk and
# X-window include files.

   TK_INCL=""

# Optional: Needed by RVDRIV (/xrv).
# The arguments needed by the C compiler to locate Rivet, Tcl, Tk and
# X-window include files.

   RV_INCL=""

# Mandatory.
# The FORTRAN compiler to use.

   FCOMPL="nagf95"

# Mandatory.
# The FORTRAN compiler flags to use when compiling the pgplot library.
# (NB. makemake prepends -c to $FFLAGC where needed)

   FFLAGC="-O"

# Mandatory.
# The FORTRAN compiler flags to use when compiling fortran demo programs.
# This may need to include a flag to tell the compiler not to treat
# backslash characters as C-style escape sequences

   FFLAGD=""

# Mandatory.
# The C compiler to use.

   CCOMPL="gcc"

# Mandatory.
# The C compiler flags to use when compiling the pgplot library.

   CFLAGC="-DPG_PPU -O2"

# Mandatory.
# The C compiler flags to use when compiling C demo programs.

   CFLAGD="-O2"

# Optional: Only needed if the cpgplot library is to be compiled.
# The flags to use when running pgbind to create the C pgplot wrapper
# library. (See pgplot/cpg/pgbind.usage)

   PGBIND_FLAGS="bsd"

# Mandatory.
# The library-specification flags to use when linking normal pgplot
# demo programs.

   LIBS="-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 \`\$(SRC)/cpg/libgcc_path.sh\` -lgcc -lm -lc"

# Optional: Needed by XMDRIV (/xmotif).
# The library-specification flags to use when linking motif
# demo programs.

   MOTIF_LIBS=""

# Optional: Needed by TKDRIV (/xtk).
# The library-specification flags to use when linking Tk demo programs.
# Note that you may need to append version numbers to -ltk and -ltcl.

   TK_LIBS=""

# Mandatory.
# On systems that have a ranlib utility, put "ranlib" here. On other
# systems put ":" here (Colon is the Bourne-shell do-nothing command).

   RANLIB="ranlib"

# Optional: Needed on systems that support shared libraries.
# The name to give the shared pgplot library.

   SHARED_LIB=""

# Optional: Needed if SHARED_LIB is set.
# How to create a shared library from a trailing list of object files.

   SHARED_LD=""

# Optional:
# On systems such as Solaris 2.x, that allow specification of the
# libraries that a shared library needs to be linked with when a
# program that uses it is run, this variable should contain the
# library-specification flags used to specify these libraries to
# $SHARED_LD

   SHARED_LIB_LIBS=""

# Optional:
# Compiler name used on Next systems to compile objective-C files.

   MCOMPL=""

# Optional:
# Compiler flags used with MCOMPL when compiling objective-C files.

   MFLAGC=""

# Optional: (Actually mandatory, but already defined by makemake).
# Where to look for any system-specific versions of the files in
# pgplot/sys. Before evaluating this script, makemake sets SYSDIR to
# /wherever/pgplot/sys_$OS, where $OS is the operating-system name
# given by the second command-line argument of makemake. If the
# present configuration is one of many for this OS, and it needs
# different modifications to files in pgplot/sys than the other
# configurations, then you should create a subdirectory of SYSDIR,
# place the modified files in it and change the following line to
# $SYSDIR="$SYSDIR/subdirectory_name".

   SYSDIR="$SYSDIR/nag_src"
