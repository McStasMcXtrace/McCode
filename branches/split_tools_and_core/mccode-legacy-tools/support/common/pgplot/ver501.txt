PGPLOT changes in Version 5.0.1

This version corrects several minor bugs; corrects a serious error in PGGRAY;
adds functionality to the X window driver; adds a new driver for X window dump
files.

pgplot
     aaaread.me
          Split into files aaaread.me, install.txt, whatsnew.txt, changes.txt.
     drivers.list
          Add warning that use of GIDRIV may require a license. Add /WD and
          /VWD (X-window dump files). Add comments to discourage people from
          trying to use PC drivers on UNIX systems. Revise /VERS and /VVERS.
     makehtml
          New perl script now generates syntactically correct html with
          cross-references [Diab Jerius].
     makemake
          Add instructions for SVdriv and WDdriv. Make it work with bash as
          well as sh. No longer makes pgplot.html by default. Remove VVdriv.
pgplot/drivers
     gidriv.f
          Avoid integer overflow (caused driver to crash on VAX/VMS). Add
          warning that use of this driver may require a license from Unisys.
     tfdriv.f
          Correct error in usage of GRFMEM.
     svdriv.c, svblock.c
          Restored from v4.9H (note: this driver for SunView is no longer
          supported: use XWdriv instead).
     vedriv.f
          Merge landscape and portrait modes in one driver.
     vvdriv.f
          Deleted.
     wddriv.f
          New file: generates X-window dump file [Scott Allendorf].
     xwdriv.c, pgxwin_server.c
          Fixes to datatypes of properties: corrects bugs found on Cray and
          Dec-Alpha (OSF/1). Support for all visual types, including TrueColor.
          Ability to set different attributes for each window via X resources.
          On VMS, checks that pgxwin_server has E or R access.
     x2driv.c, figdisp_comm.c
          Suppress warning messages produced by DECC compiler.
     bcdriv.f, ccdriv.f, hjdriv.f, ladriv.f, ljdriv.f, todriv.f, txdriv.f
          Eliminate use of routine gribf1.
pgplot/examples
     pgdemo2.f
          Add a test of an invisible polygon.
pgplot/fonts
     aaaread.me
          Note that pgunpack and pgdchar are unsupported.
pgplot/src
     grcurs.f
          Correct bug: start new picture if necessary.
     grldev.f
          Change ``Legal PGPLOT device types are:'' to ``Device types
          available:''.
     grmker.f
          Fix bug: viewport grew as symbols were plotted!
     pgband.f, pgcurs.f
          Issue message if device is not open.
     pggray.f, grgray.f
          PGGRAY now uses a color ramp between the colors assigned to color
          index 0 (background) and color index 1 (foreground). This should
          restore the old behavior: the ramp runs from black to white on
          devices with black background and white foreground, and from white to
          black on devices with white background and black foreground.
     pgpage.f
          If this routine detects that the size of the view surface has been
          changed (e.g., by a workstation window manager), it now rescales the
          viewport in proportion. Formerly the size of the viewport (in
          absolute units, e.g., mm) was not changed and so the viewport might
          extend outside the view surface. This only affects programs that do
          not reset the viewport for each page.
     pgpoly.f, grpocl.f
          Correct bug: an invisible polygon generated a spurious error message.
     pgqcs.f, pglen.f, pgqvsz.f
          Fix minor formatting errors in header comments.
     pgqinf.f
          Change version to 5.0.1.
     pgslw.f, pgqlw.f, grslw.f
          Correct header comments (line width unit is 0.005 inch).
pgplot/sys
     gribf1.f
          Deleted (also system-dependent variants).
     grfileio.c
          Add O_TRUNC to cause truncation when an existing file is overwritten.
pgplot/sys_convex
     fc_cc.conf
          Added -lX11.
pgplot/sys_cray
     aaaread.me
          Removed note about /XWIN: it now works.
     grfileio.c
          add O_TRUNC to cause truncation when an existing file is overwritten.
pgplot/sys_linux
     aaaread.me
          New file: note that many drivers cannot be compiled; note about
          disabling backslash interpretation.
     f77_gcc.conf
          Corrected to use ranlib, and revised list of libraries.
pgplot/sys_next
     pgview/PGView.m
          [Allyn Tennant] Correct resize bar.
     af77_src/grfileio.c
          add O_TRUNC to cause truncation when an existing file is overwritten.
pgplot/sys_sol2
     aaaread.me
          Added warning about non-ANSI C compilers.
pgplot/sys_sun
     aaaread.me
          Added note about SunView driver.
pgplot/sys_vms
     build.com
          Add PGQITF, PGSITF, PGPANL to transfer vector.
     grfileio.c
          Suppress warning messages produced by DECC compiler. Add O_TRUNC to
          cause a new version of the file to be created instead of overwriting
          (usual VMS behavior).
     grlgtr.f
          Convert supplied string to uppercase before attempting to translate
          it as a logical name.
     make_demos.com
          Correct comment.
     make_font.com
          Change protection of grfont.dat.
