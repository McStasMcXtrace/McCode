<H2>Grinnell Image Display (obsolete)</H2>
<DL>

<DT>Supported device
<DD>Grinnell GMR-270 Image Display System. 

<DT>Device type code
<DD><CODE>/GRINNELL</CODE>.

<DT>Default device name
<DD><CODE>TV_DEVICE</CODE> (a logical name, usually
defined by the system manager).

<DT>Default view surface dimensions
<DD>Depends on monitor.

<DT>Resolution
<DD>The full view surface is 512  x  512 pixels. 

<DT>Color capability
<DD>Color indices 0--255 are supported. The
representation of all color indices can be changed. 

<DT>Input capability
<DD>The graphics cursor is a white cross-hair. The 
user positions the cursor using the arrow keys and PF1--PF4 keys on
his terminal keyboard (<CODE>SYS$COMMAND</CODE>). The arrow keys move the cursor in
the appropriate direction; the size of the step for each keystroke is
controlled by the PF1--PF4 keys: PF1 = 1 pixel, PF2 = 4 pixels,
PF3 = 16 pixels, PF4 = 64 pixels. The user indicates that the
cursor has been positioned by typing any character other than an
arrow or PF1--PF4 key [control characters, e.g., ctrl-C, and other
special characters should be avoided, as they may be intercepted by
the operating system]. 

<DT>File format
<DD>It is not possible to send Grinnell plots to a 
disk file.

<DT>Obtaining hardcopy
<DD>Not possible.

<DT>Author
<DD>T. J. Pearson, 1989.
