McStas 2.0, code for setting up editors for McStas syntax highlighting
The editor shipped with McStas McGUI has syntax highlighting built-in.

NEDIT:
nedit should be copied to a .nedit file in your home directory

KATE (KDE):
mcstas.xml is for usage with the excellent kate editor of KDE. Copy the 
file to e.g. (Correct path on a Debian system)
  mcstas.xml -> /usr/share/apps/katepart/syntax/ 

GEDIT (Gnome):
mcstas1.lang and mcstas2.lang are for usage under Gnome. Gedit uses gtksourceview. The 
syntax definition file should be copied in e.g. (Correct path on a Debian system)
  mcstas1.lang -> /usr/share/gtksourceview-1.0/language-specs/ 
  mcstas2.lang -> /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/ 

(X)EMACS:
McStas is not C only, but quite close. The contents of the provided emacs
file should be entered in your .emacs file, setting font-lock-mode by
default and using the standard c-mode for McStas .instr files.
Note: Works also on Win32, copy the .emacs file to c:\ :-)
