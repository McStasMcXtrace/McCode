  * Providing a script or target name is now mandatory. The new syntax:
       set terminal lua <target name> | "<file name>"
                        {<script_args> ...}
    This will look for a script named `gnuplot-<target name>.lua' or
    a script named "<file name>" (in quotes!).
  * Support for script names via the environmental variable
    GNUPLOT_LUA_SCRIPT is dropped.
  * The option "script" is obsolete and also removed.
  * Via the environmental variable GNUPLOT_DRIVER_DIR the default search
    directory for driver scripts can be changed.
  * The TikZ driver help is now included as a subsection of the Lua
    terminal.
  * minor bugfixes (see ChangeLog)

  This version drops backward compatibility again!

2008-12-20

  * Removed all underscrores in style and color names.
  * The plot box coordinates are now accessible via a special node. (e.g.
    "gp plot 1.north east".
  * Added aliases 'standalone' ('fulldoc') and 'header' ('preamble')
  * Preparations to echo back the options string to the user.

  This version drops backward compatibility!

2008-11-22

  * Changed default canvas size to 12.5cm x 8.75cm and use the preview
    package to clip the plot in 'fulldoc' mode (suggested by Juergen Wieferink).
  * New option 'charsize'. In conjunction with the gnuplottex.sty the
    font size can now be determined automatically. (look at the style file for
    example code).
  * Removed the default font setting (previously set to "\small").

  No binary updates needed.

2008-02-02

  * Implemented a mapping of gnuplot arrow styles to TikZ arrow styles by
    "misusing" the angle of the gnuplot arrow definition.
  * CMYK support for image data (all other colors are handled through the
    xcolor package).
  * terminal works with gnuplottex (\begin{gnuplot}[terminal=lua]...)
    (http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/gnuplottex.html)
  * compatibility updates for gnuplot 4.3cvs version
  * optional environment variable GNUPLOT_LUA_SCRIPT
  * fixed zero length paths artifacts and some more minor bugs
  * added simple pager functionality for help output

  The Lua script should work with the previous binary version, but the new
  GNUPLOT_LUA_SCRIPT feature and pager functionality will not be available.
  Maybe a minor issue for most users ;-)

2007-10-03

  * New option 'providevars' to make gnuplot's internal and user variables
    available within the TeX-script.
  * Adopted the color scheme and dash patterns to (largely) resemble the
    look of the postscript terminal.
  * Changed the names of the bounding box coordinates from 'lowerleft' to
    'south west' etc. to be closer to the TikZ naming scheme.

  Binary update needed on upgrade.

2007-09-22

  * Lengths in the 'size' options now accept the units cm, mm, in or inch, pt,
    pc, bp, dd and cc.
  * Switched from generic TikZ styles like 'every plot' to gnuplot specific
    TikZ-styles.
  * Support for plotting images of pixel and binary 2D-data. For PDF and
    Postscript generation the image will be included in a native PDF or PS
    format what reduces space and compile time and improves rendering quality.
    For the SVG output of PGF/TikZ the 'native image' feature has to be
    disabled manually. The image will then be rendered of filled rectangles.
  * Added 'tikzplot' option which allows using the TikZ '\path plot'
    command instead of the simple '\path' for plots with given linetypes.
  * Added 'is_multiplot()' to the Lua terminal (currently unused in the
    TikZ backend).
  * Changed the Lua-API: Color and fill styles are now passed as strings
    instead of integers to the script.

  Binary update needed on upgrade.

2007-08-25 ii
  
  * Improved robustness of the option parser.
  * Fixed a PGF/TikZ compatibility issue reported by Scott Murman.
    
  No binary update from previous version needed.


2007-08-25

  * Fixed rectangle scaling in conjunction with the 'plotsize' option
    (thanks to Scott Murman for reporting).
  
  This update only affects the gnuplot.lua script.


2007-08-24

  * A 'size' option for the canvas was added.
  * The 'scale' option now expects an x and y parameter, so the
    'xscale' and 'yscale' options where removed. Scaling and resizing
    now work similar to the other terminals.
  * The 'monochrome' and 'solid' options do not change the actual
    TikZ plot commands anymore, but only change the according TikZ
    style settings.
