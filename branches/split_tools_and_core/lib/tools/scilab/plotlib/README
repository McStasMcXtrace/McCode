Installation
============
To Install this library : (Scilab >= 3.1.1)

We Suppose here that <PATH> stands for  the path of the directory
containing this README file.

        The user has to execute, once and for all, the following instruction
        within Scilab:

        exec <PATH>/builder.sce

        This operation requires permission to write in <PATH>/macros
        to generate *.bin, names and lib files in <PATH>/macros
        directory.

        To load the library, execute the following instruction within Scilab:

        exec <PATH>/loader.sce

        You can also put this instruction in your .scilab startup file for 
        automatic loading. 

        -> UNIX/Linux/Darwin : the location of this startup file is 

               $HOME/.Scilab/Scilab-3.1-rc1/

           if you are using Scilab-3.1-rc1, or 

                $HOME/.Scilab/Scilab-3.1-rc1-CVS/

       	   if you are using the CVS version.
