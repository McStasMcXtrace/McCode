the renderers here try to construct header files and implementation files
of cpp classes. It is intended to be used as a generic cpp class
factory.

it is created because of the need to convert McStas components to
cpp classes. The idea is, McStas component is written by using 
a META language with c codes, why not just create a  c++ class
out of that compnent? Then we should be able to use that c++ class
as we will.

The c++ class renderer here should not have any limit to be used
only by mcstas wrapper. But it ended up here because it is
still in its experiment stage.
