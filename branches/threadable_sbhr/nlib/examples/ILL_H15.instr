*
* The H15@ILL curved cold guide at the ILL (feeding IN6, D7, IN10, D11)
*
* %Description
* The H15@ILL curved guide sending cold neutrons from the VCS to IN6
*
* %Example: m=1 Detector: GuideOut_Phic_I=1.16e10
*
* %Parameters
* m:          (1)  m-value of whole guide coating. 0 absorbing, 1 for Ni, 1.2 for Ni58, 2-4 for SM
* mip:        (1)  m-value of in-pile guide coating
* lambda:     (AA) central wavelength
* dlambda:    (AA) wavelength half width. Use e.g. 0.8*lambda for white beam.
