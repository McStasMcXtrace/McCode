--------------------------

CHANGES v2.20, released, May 16th 2007
--------------------------------------

* Doug Burke's Makefile.PL patch - re-org and better OS X support.

* Added INSTALL, INSTALL-MacOSX and INSTALL-Win32 instruction files and updated README

CHANGES v2.19, released Jan 3rd, 2006
-------------------------------------

CHANGES v2.17, released May 8th, 2000
-------------------------------------

* Changed my email address.

CHANGES v2.16, released Mar 10th, 2000
--------------------------------------

* Added function struct to allow access to expose certain PGPLOT
  routines to the outside (currently cpgmove, cpgdraw)

CHANGES 2.15 released Oct 26th 1999
-----------------------------------

* Fixed Makefile.PL minor problem

CHANGES 2.14 released Oct 15th 1999
-----------------------------------

* Updated HELP some more.
* Removed ExtUtils from distribution and made seperate to avoid confusing
  CPAN, is now a PREREQ_PM
* Removed erroneous reference in PGPLOT.pm (Charles Lane).
* Added HINTS.irix

CHANGES v2.13 released May 14th, 1999
--------------------------------------

* Updates to ExtUtils::F77 (now v1.10) (q.t.) for RedHat 6.0 etc.

CHANGES v2.12 released May 11th, 1999
--------------------------------------

* Added PGPLOT_DIR to path for include files.
* Removed pgpt1 and pgerrb1 left over from old perl4 version - see
  pgcompatbility.p if you still need them.
* Changed macro names for perl 5.004_53 (Joshua Pritikin 
  <joshua.pritikin@db.com>) and inserted a conditional so older perl's
  still work.
* More ExtUtils::F77 changes (now at v1.09)  
* Small test.pl patch from Chuck Lane <lane@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu>
* Fixed error in test12.p
  
CHANGES v2.11 released Sep 11th, 1998
--------------------------------------

* Added support for PGPLOT_DIR in Makefile.PL, updated HELP.
* Mentioned 'perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=...' in README.
* More HELP stuff.
* ExtUtils::F77 v1.08

CHANGES v2.10 released May 21st, 1998.
--------------------------------------

* Various changes to ExtUtils::F77 q.v.

CHANGES v2.09 released 17/Feb/98
--------------------------------

* Documented xubpp problem in HELP because I got fed uo
  with waiting for p5p to fix. No other changes.

CHANGES v2.08 released 8/Jan/98
-------------------------------

* Added improved -lgcc support.
* PGPLOT version check in test12.p

CHANGES (v2.06 to 2.07)
------------------------

* Added support for new functions in PGPLOT 5.2.0 library. Note: TK
  driver looks nice but haven't yet implemented this in perl version.
  Presumably can be done with perl/Tk.
  
* Extra test12.p for new routines

* No longer supporting binary versions in any shape or form. Life is too 
  short. Get a FORTRAN compiler. :-)

* Added -lgcc for gcc built perls in ExtUtils::F77

CHANGES (v2.02 to 2.06)
------------------------

(OK I know I should have been more organised about updating this
file!)

* Important bug fixes to array packing code which is now 
  called arrays.{c,h}

* Added fake MAIN__ symbol to stop annoying bug reports about some
  versions of gcc. :-)

* arrays.c now supports unsigned chars and shorts. (Thanks Tim!)

* Additions to HELP and documentation

* Patches to improve ExtUtils::F77

* Improvements to tests

* pgcompatibilty.p (NOT INSTALLED!) defines simple compatibilty
  routines for perl4 pgperl version. This had some gnarly single point
  versions of routines which are now superfluous.


CHANGES (v2.02 from 2.01) 
-------------------------

o Made Makefile.PL more clever.

o Added a file HELP with useful problem fixing information.

o Fixed some small type cast bugs in kgbpack.c

CHANGES (v2.01 from 1.0b) 
-------------------------

o No longer providing perl4 version.

o All the array packing functions reimplemented in C to improve
  speed and robustness.

o Simplified build procedure - PGPLOT module should now build
  in standard Perl way. (i.e. 'perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make
  install'). Makefile.PL should not have to be edited and upgrading
  should now be much easier.

o Added 'pass by reference' convention to allow explicit use of
  pre-packed binary data.

o Supports pgplot routines up to pgplot v5.1.1.

o Added POD documentation.

o FORTRAN link support is now via ExtUtils::F77 module (included).

o Now providing binaries of pgplot libraries for various
  architectures rather than statically-linked module binaries. This
  should make upgrading easier.

o Removed special one-point routine versions (hang-over from
  perl4 version).

o Removed pgplot.pl (again a hang-over from old perl4 version).

o General tidy up and reorganisation of distribution
