400.202 -> 400.203

o Added the Tix form geometry manager including
  documentation. Attachments specified as '%n' or '&w' have not been
  tested yet.

o Implemented the labeled frame widget (LabFrame)

o Got rid of a nasty bug in Balloon that would cause the Balloon help
  system to fail if it was destroyed.

o The status bar now gets instantly updated when cursor passes over a
  client while the balloon pops up only if cursor pauses over a
  client.

o Added -browsecmd and -listcmd options to BrowseEntry.pm

o Added delete() method for BrowseEntry.pm

o Fixed callbacks for -raisecmd and -createcmd in NoteBook.pm /
  VStack.pm so that they receive the frame representing the page
  as an argument.

o Fixed menu traversal code in NoteBook.pm so that <Alt> keybindings
  work as expected.
