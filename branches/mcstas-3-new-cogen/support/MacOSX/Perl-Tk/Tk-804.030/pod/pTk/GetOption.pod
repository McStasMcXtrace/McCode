=head1 DESCRIPTION

This procedure is invoked to retrieve an option from the database
associated with I<tkwin>'s main window.  If there is an option
for I<tkwin> that matches the given I<name> or I<class>,
then it is returned in the form of a Tk_Uid.  If multiple options
match I<name> and I<class>, then the highest-priority one
is returned.  If no option matches, then NULL is returned.

B<Tk_GetOption> caches options related to I<tkwin> so that
successive calls for the same I<tkwin> will execute much more
quickly than successive calls for different windows.
