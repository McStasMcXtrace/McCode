The Tk804 series is considered production worthy since Tk804.027.
(Previous stable release being Tk800.025.)

This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.4.
C code is derived from Tcl/Tk8.4.5.
It also includes all the C code parts of Tix8.1.4 from SourceForge.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

Perl API is essentially the same as Tk800 series Tk800.025 but has not
been verified as compliant. There ARE differences see pod/804delta.pod.

The goal of this release is Unicode support via perl's and
core-tk's use of UTF-8.
Tk804.027 builds and loads into a threaded perl but is NOT
yet thread safe.

This Tk804 works only with perl5.8.0 or later.
Perl's UTF-8 support has improved since it was introduced in perl5.6.0.
Some functions (regular expression match in Text widgets) are known
to only work with perl5.8.1 and later

The latest Perl/Tk version running with perl5.6.x is Tk800.025.
The latest Perl/Tk version running with perl5.005_xx is Tk800.024.

There are a lot more tests in Tk804. Some notably t/entry.t and
t/listbox.t very dependant on the available fonts and to a lesser
extent the window manager used. As a rule of thumb older window
managers like twm, fvwm2, and windowmaker are more robust than newer
like Metacity (often used in GNOME), kwin (the KDE window manager), or
xfwm4.

Others t/JP.t and t/KR.t need oriental fonts and can take a long time to
run on a machine with a lot of fonts but which lacks the glyphs tests are
looking for.

By default Perl/Tk makes use of client side fonts via freetype2,
fontconfig and Xft on Unix systems. This gives anti-aliased fonts for
regular text (if you have TrueType or Type1 fonts and they are in your
fontconfig config file). See also http://fontconfig.org .
To disable this feature run the Makefile.PL
with "perl Makefile.PL XFT=0".

Note that the default fontconfig configuration may or may not include
traditional X11 fonts. Please inspect /etc/fonts/fonts.conf or
/usr/local/etc/fonts/fonts.conf files for the values of the <dir>
elements. Users may add additional font directories in their
~/.fonts.conf . See
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.html
for more information.
