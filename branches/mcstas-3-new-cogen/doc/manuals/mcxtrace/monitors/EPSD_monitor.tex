\section{EPSD\_monitor: Energy-selective PSD monitor}
\index{Monitors!Position Sensitive Detector (PSD), Energy Selective}

\mcdoccomp{monitors/EPSD_monitor.parms}

The \textbf{EPSD\_monitor} closely resembles \textbf{PSD\_monitor} with the difference that
this component may be given an energy interval: $\left[E_{min},E_{max}\right]$, in which it is sensitive.
Photon rays falling within this interval are detected, those outside are ignored.

The output from \textbf{EPSD\_monitor} is the integrated counts, $n, I, M_2$,
as well as
three two-dimensional arrays of counts: $n(x,y), I(x,y), M_2(x,y)$.
The arrays are written to a file, \verb+filename+, and can be read e.g. by the tool
\textbf{mxplot}, see the system manual.
