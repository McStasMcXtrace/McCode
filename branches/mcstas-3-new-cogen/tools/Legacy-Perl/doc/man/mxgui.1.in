.SH NAME
mxgui \- graphical user interface of the McXtrace x-ray ray-trace simulation package
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mxgui
[\-\-open] [file.instr]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mxgui
command is the graphical user interface of the McXtrace package. It has the following features: Loading instruments and editing their descriptions, compiling them, running single simulations, as well as scans of parameters, usage of parallel computation (when available), parameter optimization to maximize monitor values, plotting of simulation results and instrument geometry, access to instrument templates and plenty of documentation.
.PP
.B McXtrace
is a general tool for simulating x-ray scattering instruments and experiments. It is actively supported by
.I DTU Physics,
.I ILL, 
and
.I PSI

.PP
McXtrace is based on a compiler [mcxtrace(1)] that reads a high-level specification language defining the instrument to be simulated and produces C code that performs the Monte Carlo Simulation. The system is very fast in use, both when setting up the instrument definition and when doing calculations.
.PP
McXtrace supports all x-ray scattering instruments. It comes with a comprehensive manual and a library of well-tested components that include most standard elements of x-ray scattering instruments, including steady-state and pulsed sources, powder samples, choppers, and a variety of detectors.
.PP
The package consists of the following user commands:
.TP
.B mxgui(1)
is the graphical user interface. Then use the
.I X-ray Site
menu to select an example instrument, and access the whole documentation for the
.I Help
menu. It contains an instrument editor, methods to plot simulation results, and much more
.TP
mxrun(1)
is the command-line tool for building and running simulations
.TP
mxplot(1)
is the simulation results plotting tool
.TP
mxdisplay(1)
is the instrument geometry and x-ray trajectory viewer
.TP
mxdoc(1)
is the documentation tool
.TP
mcxtrace(1)
is the instrument compiler
.TP
mxformat(1)
can transform any text data set from one format to an other. It does not support conversion from binary data sets. It can also merge equivalent results.
.PP
We encourage users to refer to the User and Component Manuals, which are available with the command
.B
mxdoc
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
file.instr
loads the specified instrument when starting
.TP
\-\-open
will open the instrument editor window
.TP
\-\-edit
will only open the instrument editor window (no main/simulation window)
.TP
\-\-help
display command help
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Typical usage
.B mxgui
.TP
Open the foo.instr instrument
mxgui foo.instr
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The
.B MCXTRACE
environment variable may be set to define the McXtrace library location. This is /usr/local/lib/mcxtrace on Linux systems. Executables are usually located in /usr/local/bin.
The McXtrace configuration file is MCXTRACE/tools/perl/mccode_config.perl
.P
The
.B MCXTRACE_FORMAT
environment variable may be set to define the default data format used for storing results. This is usually 'PGPLOT'.
.P
The
.B
MCXTRACE_CC
environment variable may be set to define the compiler to use (e.g. gcc)
.P
The
.B
MCXRACE_CFLAGS
environment variable may be set to define the options for compilation (e.g. -O2)
.P
The
.B BROWSER
environment variable may be set to define the default HTML browser to use
.SH BUGS
Some implementations of Perl-Tk do not support desktop switching and windows redraw. This may crash mxgui.
McXtrace is a large package, and bugs might be found. If so, please report to
