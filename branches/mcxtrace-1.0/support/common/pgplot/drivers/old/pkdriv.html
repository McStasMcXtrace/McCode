<H2>Peritek VCH-Q Display, 1024-pixel</H2>
<DL>

<DT>Supported device
<DD>Peritek Corp. VCK-Q frame-buffer video 
interface with HD63484 ACRTC, using a custom VMS device driver.
(Peritek Corp., 5550 Redwood Rd., Oakland, CA 94619, 415-531-6500)

<DT>Device type code
<DD><CODE>/PK</CODE>.

<DT>Default device name
<DD><CODE>PKA0</CODE>:

<DT>Default view surface dimensions
<DD>Depends on monitor.

<DT>Resolution
<DD>The full view surface is 1024 x 1024 pixels. 

<DT>Color capability
<DD>Color indices 0--255 are supported. The
representation of all color indices can be changed. Define logical name
<CODE>PGPLOT_MONITOR</CODE> = <CODE>MONOCHROME</CODE> to use a monochrome monitor: colors
are then converted to shades of gray.

<DT>Input capability
<DD>The graphics cursor is a white cross-hair. The 
user positions the cursor using the arrow keys and PF1--PF4 keys on
his terminal keyboard (<CODE>SYS$COMMAND</CODE>). The arrow keys move the cursor in
the appropriate direction; the size of the step for each keystroke is
controlled by the PF1--PF4 keys: PF1 = 1 pixel, PF2 = 4 pixels,
PF3 = 16 pixels, PF4 = 64 pixels. The user indicates that the
cursor has been positioned by typing any character other than an
arrow or PF1--PF4 key [control characters, eg, ctrl-C, and other
special characters should be avoided, as they may be intercepted by
the operating system].
