The component \textbf{E\_monitor} is sensitive to
the xray energy, which in binned in \textit{nE} bins between
$E_\mathrm{min}$ and $E_\mathrm{max}$ (in keV).

The output parameters from \texttt{E\_monitor} are the total counts,
and a file with 1-dimensional data vs. $E$, similar to \texttt{TOF\_monitor}.
