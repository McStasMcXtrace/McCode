\section{Lens\_parab\_rough: Thick parabolic CRL including roughness-model}
\label{s:lens-parab-rough}
\index{Optics!lens}
\mcdoccomp{optics/Lens_parab_rough.parms}

Identical to \textbf{Lens\_parab} except it has the option of a \textit{roughness} parameter.
Roughness is simply modelled by a stochatstic, normally distributed, displacement of the normal vector of the lens surfaces.

This component and its functionality is scheduled to be merged into \textbf{Lens\_parab}
