.SH NAME
mxplot \- simulation results plotter of the McXtrace x-ray trace simulation package
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mxplot
[\-ps|\-psc|\-gif] <simfile | detector_file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mxplot
command is the simulation results plotter of the McXtrace package.
.PP
.B McXtrace
is a general tool for simulating neutron scattering instruments and experiments. It is actively supported by
.I DTU Physics,
.I ESRF,
and
.I University of Copenhagen

.PP
McXtrace is based on a compiler [mcxtrace(1)] that reads a high-level specification language defining the instrument to be simulated and produces C code that performs the Monte Carlo Simulation. The system is very fast in use, both when setting up the instrument definition and when doing calculations.
.PP
McXtrace supports all x-ray scattering instruments. It comes with a comprehensive manual and a library of well-tested components that include most standard elements of x-ray scattering instruments, including steady-state and pulsed sources, monochromators/analysers, powder samples, choppers, and a variety of detectors.
.PP
The package consists of the following user commands:
.TP
mxgui(1)
is the graphical user interface. Then use the
.I Neutron Site
menu to select an example instrument, and access the whole documentation for the
.I Help
menu. It contains an instrument editor, methods to plot simulation results, and much more
.TP
mxrun(1)
is the command-line tool for building and running simulations
.TP
.B mxplot(1)
is the simulation results plotting tool
.TP
mxdisplay(1)
is the instrument geometry and neutron trajectory viewer
.TP
mxdoc(1)
is the documentation tool
.TP
mcxtrace(1)
is the instrument compiler
.TP
mxformat(1)
can transform any text data set from one format to an other. It does not support conversion from binary data sets. It can also merge equivalent results.
.PP
We encourage users to refer to the User and Component Manuals, which are available with the command
.B
mxdoc

.SH OPTIONS
The usage of the command does not require option. Refer to mxplot \-h for special uses.
.TP
\-h | \-\-help
displays the command help
.TP
\-ps|\-psc|\-gif|\-png
saves plot as a ps/color ps/gif/png file and exits
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Typical usage (plots last results in current directory)
.B mxplot
.TP
Plots results in current directory DIR
mxplot DIR
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The
.B MCXTRACE
environment variable may be set to define the McXtrace library location. This is /usr/local/lib/mcxtrace on Linux systems. Executables are usually located in /usr/local/bin.
.SH BUGS
McXtrace is a large package, and bugs might be found. If so, please report to
