[odls-default:could-not-kill]
WARNING: A process refused to die!

Host: %s
PID:  %d

This process may still be running and/or consuming resources.

[odls-default:could-not-send-kill]
WARNING: A process refused the kill SIGTERM signal!
         This should never happen unless the application is changing the
         parent/child relationship permissions.

Host:  %s
PID:   %d
Errno: %d

This process may still be running and/or consuming resources.

[orte-odls-default:execv-error]
Could not execute the executable "%s": %s

This could mean that your PATH or executable name is wrong, or that you do not
have the necessary permissions.  Please ensure that the executable is able to be
found and executed.

#
[nodeid-out-of-range]
The id of a node is out of the allowed range.

Value given: %ld
Max value allowed: %ld

This may be resolved by increasing the number of available node id's by
re-configuring Open MPI with the --enable-jumbo-clusters option, and then
re-running the application
#
[odls-default:multiple-paffinity-schemes]
Multiple processor affinity schemes were specified (can only specify one):

Slot list: %s
opal_paffinity_alone:  true

Please specify only the one desired method.
#
[odls-default:slot-list-failed]
We were unable to successfully process/set the requested processor
affinity settings:

Specified slot list: %s
Error: %s

This could mean that a non-existent processor was specified, or
that the specification had improper syntax.
#
[odls-default:invalid-node-rank]
An invalid node rank was obtained - this is probably something
that should be reported to the OMPI developers.
#
[odls-default:invalid-local-rank]
An invalid local rank was obtained - this is probably something
that should be reported to the OMPI developers.
#
[odls-default:invalid-phys-cpu]
An invalid physical processor ID was returned when attempting to bind
an MPI process to a unique processor on node:

  Node: %s

This usually means that you requested binding to more processors than
exist (e.g., trying to bind N MPI processes to M processors, where N >
M), or that the node has an unexpectedly different topology.

Double check that you have enough unique processors for all the
MPI processes that you are launching on this host, and that all nodes
have identical topologies.

You job will now abort.
#
[odls-default:failed-set-paff]
An attempt to set processor affinity has failed - please check to
ensure that your system supports such functionality. If so, then
this is probably something that should be reported to the OMPI developers.
#
[odls-default:topo-not-supported]
An attempt was made to bind a process to a specific hardware topology
mapping (e.g., binding to a socket) but the operating system does not
support such topology-aware actions.  Talk to your local system
administrator to find out if your system can support topology-aware
functionality (e.g., Linux Kernels newer than v2.6.18).

Systems that do not support processor topology-aware functionality cannot
use "bind to socket" and other related functionality.

  Local host:        %s
  Action attempted:  %s %s
  Application name:  %s
#
[odls-default:binding-not-avail]
A request to bind the processes if the operating system supports
such an operation was made, but the OS does not support this operation:

  Local host:        %s
  Action requested:  %s
  Application name:  %s

Because the request was made on an "if-available" basis, the job was
launched without taking the requested action. If this is not the desired
behavior, talk to your local system administrator to find out if your
system can support the requested action.
#
[odls-default:not-enough-resources]
Not enough %s were found on the local host to meet the requested
binding action:

  Local host:        %s
  Action requested:  %s
  Application name:  %s

Please revise the request and try again.
#
[odls-default:could-not-bind-to-socket]
Open MPI unexpectedly failed to bind a process to a socket.

  Local host:   %s
  Socket index: %d

Your job will now abort.
