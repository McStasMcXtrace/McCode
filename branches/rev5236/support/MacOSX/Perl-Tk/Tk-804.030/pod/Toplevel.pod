Tk::Toplevel - Create and manipulate Toplevel widgets

=for category  Tk Widget Classes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

S<    >I<$toplevel> = I<$parent>-E<gt>B<Toplevel>(?I<options>?);

=head1 STANDARD OPTIONS

B<-borderwidth>	B<-highlightbackground>	B<-highlightthickness>	B<-takefocus>
B<-class>	B<-highlightcolor>	B<-relief>
B<-cursor>

See L<Tk::options> for details of the standard options.

=head1 WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS

=over 4

=item Name:	B<background>

=item Class:	B<Background>

=item Switch:	B<-background>

This option is the same as the standard B<background> option
except that its value may also be specified as an undefined value.
In this case, the widget will display no background or border, and
no colors will be consumed from its colormap for its background
and border.

=item Name:	B<colormap>

=item Class:	B<Colormap>

=item Switch:	B<-colormap>

Specifies a colormap to use for the window.
The value may be either B<new>, in which case a new colormap is
created for the window and its children, or the name of another
window (which must be on the same screen and have the same visual
as $widget), in which case the new window will use the colormap
from the specified window.
If the B<colormap> option is not specified, the new window
uses the default colormap of its screen.
This option may not be changed with the B<configure>
method.

=item Name:	B<container>

=item Class:	B<Container>

=item Switch:	B<-container>

The value must be a boolean.  If true, it means that this window will
be used as a container in which some other application will be embedded
(for example, a Tk toplevel can be embedded using the B<-use> option).
The window will support the appropriate window manager protocols for
things like geometry requests.  The window should not have any
children of its own in this application.
This option may not be changed with the B<configure>
method.

=item Name:	B<height>

=item Class:	B<Height>

=item Switch:	B<-height>

Specifies the desired height for the window in any of the forms
acceptable to B<Tk_GetPixels>.
If this option is less than or equal to zero then the window will
not request any size at all.

=item Name:	B<menu>

=item Class:	B<Menu>

=item Switch:	B<-menu>

Specifies a menu widget to be used as a menubar. On the Macintosh, the
menubar will be displayed accross the top of the main monitor. On
Microsoft Windows and all UNIX platforms, the menu will appear accross
the toplevel window as part of the window dressing maintained by the
window manager.

=item Name:	B<"">

=item Class:	B<"">

=item Switch:	B<-screen>

Specifies the screen on which to place the new window.
Any valid screen name may be used, even one associated with a
different display.
Defaults to the same screen as its parent.
This option is special in that it may not be specified via the option
database, and it may not be modified with the B<configure>
method.

=item Switch:	B<-title>

Specifies the title of the toplevel window.

=item Name:	B<use>

=item Class:	B<Use>

=item Switch:	B<-use>

This option is used for embedding. If the value isn't an empty string,
it must be the the window identifier of a container window, specified as
a hexadecimal string like the ones returned by the B<winfo id>
command. The toplevel widget will be created as a child of the given
container instead of the root window for the screen.  If the container
window is in a Tk application, it must be a frame or toplevel widget for
which the B<-container> option was specified.
This option may not be changed with the B<configure>
method.

=item Name:	B<visual>

=item Class:	B<Visual>

=item Switch:	B<-visual>

Specifies visual information for the new window in any of the
forms accepted by B<Tk_GetVisual>.
If this option is not specified, the new window will use the default
visual for its screen.
The B<visual> option may not be modified with the B<configure>
method.

=item Name:	B<width>

=item Class:	B<Width>

=item Switch:	B<-width>

Specifies the desired width for the window in any of the forms
acceptable to B<Tk_GetPixels>.
If this option is less than or equal to zero then the window will
not request any size at all.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<Toplevel> method creates a new toplevel widget (given
by the $widget argument).  Additional
options, described above, may be specified on the command line
or in the option database
to configure aspects of the toplevel such as its background color
and relief.  The B<toplevel> command returns the
path name of the new window.

A toplevel is similar to a frame except that it is created as a
top-level window:  its X parent is the root window of a screen
rather than the logical parent from its path name.  The primary
purpose of a toplevel is to serve as a container for dialog boxes
and other collections of widgets.  The only visible features
of a toplevel are its background color and an optional 3-D border
to make the toplevel appear raised or sunken.

=head1 WIDGET METHODS

The B<Toplevel> method creates a widget object.
This object supports the B<configure> and B<cget> methods
described in L<Tk::options> which can be used to enquire and
modify the options described above.
The widget also inherits all the methods provided by the generic
L<Tk::Widget|Tk::Widget> class, and the L<Tk::Wm|Tk::Wm> class.

=head1 BINDINGS

When a new toplevel is created, it has no default event bindings:
toplevels are not intended to be interactive.
