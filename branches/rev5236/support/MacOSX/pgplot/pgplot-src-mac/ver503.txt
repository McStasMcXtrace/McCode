PGPLOT version 5.0.3

Tested Systems

Version 5.0.3 has been tested with the following operating systems and
compilers. Drivers tested include: GI, GL, NU, PP, PS, TT, VT, WD, X2, XW (but
not all combinations of drivers and systems have been tested exhaustively).

   * HP-UX version A.09.01, HP Fortran/9000 (fort77), HP C (c89).
   * OpenVMS AXP V6.1, DEC FORTRAN V6.2, DEC C V4.0 (tested on DEC 3000/M600).
   * OpenVMS VAX V6.1, DEC FORTRAN V6.2, DEC C V4.0 (tested on VAXstation
     4000-90). Note: the PGDISP server cannot be compiled on this system.
   * Solaris 2.4 (SunOS 5.4), Sun Fortran 2.0.1, Sun C 2.0.1 (tested on
     SPARCstation 10).
   * SunOS 4.1.4, Sun Fortran 1.3.1, cc (tested on SPARCstation IPX). Note: the
     C-binding cannot be compiled with this non-ANSI C compiler.
   * SunOS 4.1.4, Sun Fortran 1.3.1, GNU gcc v2.7.0 (tested on SPARCstation
     IPX).

Changes in Version 5.0.3

Routine PGQCS has a new option to determine the character height in world
coordinates, and a bug that would give wrong values on devices with non-square
pixels has been corrected.

Routine PGTBOX has a new option `X' to label the HH field modulo 24. Thus, a
label such as 25h 10m would come out as 1h 10m.

Graphical output from the GIF and PPM drivers can now be directed to the
standard output by specifying a file name ``-'', e.g., ``-/gif''. This allows
output to be piped to a viewing program, e.g., ``pgprog | xv -''. This will
only work for single-page plots.

In this version I have started work to change the character coding of PGPLOT
text strings from US-ASCII to ISO Latin-1. Unfortunately I do not have
digitized versions of most of the required glyphs, so this work is not
complete. Programs which use characters with decimal codes in the range 128-255
will now display differently: in most cases, the glyph will be an approximation
to the ISO Latin-1 character (e.g., an unaccented letter instead of the
correctly accented one).

A new escape sequence, \., has been added for a centered dot (·).

A bug has been fixed that affected PostScript and possibly some other drivers:
they would ignore a change to the color-representation of the currently
selected color index.

Some changes have been made in the way PGPLOT writes BoundingBox comments in
PostScript files.

Two bugs in polygon fill have been fixed: PGPOLY would issue an error message
about a polygon with less than 3 vertices on some occasions when a polygon was
completely outside the viewport; and polygon fill was ignored completely on
some devices if the y-axis ran downwards instead of upwards.

There is one new driver (HGDRIV), for HP-GL/2 devices.

Minor corrections have been made in several other subroutines and text files.

pgplot
     aaaread.me
          Changed version number to 5.0.3.
     copyright.notice
          Changed version number to 5.0.3.
     drivers.list
          Added HGDRIV.
     install.txt
          Updated.
     makehtml
          This is a perl script used for making the html documentation file.
          Some systems had trouble executing this script. I have now modified
          it to invoke perl by the #! mechanism. You may have to modify the
          first line of the script to specify the location of perl on your
          system.
     makemake
          Now includes the ``non-standard'' routines in the documentation files
          (pgplot.doc, pgplot.html). Also modified the non-standard routines to
          get cross-references to their aliases in the HTML file. The list of
          include file dependencies is now generated by searching the code.
          Special code for the Motif widget has been added. Added HGDRIV.
     ver503.txt
          (New file.) Release notes.
pgplot/drivers
     hgdriv.f
          (New file.) Driver from Colin J. Lonsdale for HP-GL/2 devices. I have
          not tested this. It is an alternative to GLDRIV: you should probably
          not include both in your PGPLOT configuration.
     lxdriv.f
          Removed a non-standard DATA initialization.
     psdriv.f
          Changed interpretation of environment variables PGPLOT_PS_BBOX and
          PGPLOT_PS_DRAW_BBOX; see the documentation.
     xwdriv.c
          Fix an error in display of large images.
     gidriv.f, ppdriv.f, wddriv.f
          Added comments to indicate what must be changed on operating systems
          like OSF/1 that use 64-bit addresses.
pgplot/examples
     pgdemo1.f
          Fixed error in scatter plot, and rewrote random number routines.
     pgdemo2.f
          Exercise a few more escape sequences.
pgplot/src
     grdtyp.f, grldev.f
          Changed to totally ignore a PGPLOT driver that reports a zero-length
          device type. This is to allow for stub drivers (more to come on
          this).
     grfa.f
          Fix bug: polygon fill was ignored on devices for which fill must be
          emulated in PGPLOT if the y-axis was reversed.
     grfa.f, grrec0.f
          Changed to avoid use of a real variable as a do-loop index (not
          allowed by some compilers).
     grscr.f
          Fix bug that affected some drivers: if you change the color
          representation of the current color, these drivers did not notice.
     grsyds.f
          Changed to allow 304 = 256+48 characters in a font rather than 128+48
          (the `48' are the greek characters). Added \. escape sequence.
     grsymk.f
          Changed to allow 304 = 256+48 characters in a font rather than
          128+48. This is in preparation for using the ISO-Latin-1 character
          set rather than US-ASCII. Unaccented glyphs have been assigned for
          most of the ISO-Latin-1 accented characters.
     pgcl.f
          Under rare circumstances could crash with both arguments to atan2
          equal to zero. [This is an internal routine used by PGCONL].
     pgpoly.f
          Fixed a bug in the clipping algorithm that affected some polygons
          that lie entirely outside the viewport.
     pgqcs.f
          Added option UNITS=4 to determine the character height in world
          coordinates, and fixed a bug that would give wrong values on devices
          with non-square pixels.
     pgqhs.f
          Corrected comments (arguments are output, not input).
     pgqinf.f
          Changed version number to 5.0.3. Changed cursor test to determine
          whether the driver reports a cursor, rather than assuming that all
          interactive devices have cursors.
     pgtbox.f
          New option `X' to label the HH field modulo 24 [Neil Killeen].
     pgimag.f
          Minor changes to header comments.
     pgswin.f, pgwnad.f
          These routines now check whether a window of zero width or zero
          height has been requested, in order to prevent a nasty divide-by-zero
          error.
     pg*.f (many files)
          Many of the top-level PG routines have been modified to issue a
          warning message (by calling PGNOTO) if no device is open. This is in
          preparation for multiple open devices.
pgplot/sys
     grfileio.c
          Recognize file name ``-'' as standard output.
pgplot/sys_dos
     msdriv.f
          Revised device driver for PCs running DOS with Microsoft Fortran 5.0,
          from Harry Lehto. This replaces msdriv.f, msdriv.koyama, and
          msdriv.lehto.
pgplot/sys_linux
     aaaread.me
          Add notes on use of Gnu g77 compiler [Brian Toby].
     g77_gcc.conf
          (New file.) Configuration file for Gnu g77 compiler [Brian Toby].
pgplot/sys_mac
     (New directory.) Macintosh OS, LS Fortran 2.1. See file aaaread.me.
pgplot/sys_msdos
     aaaread.me
          Added information about a serious bug in the Microsoft Powerstation
          Fortran compiler [from C. T. Dum].
pgplot/sys_osf1
     aaaread.me
          Added notes about the 64-bit address problem: some PGPLOT device
          drivers must be modified to be used with this operating system.
     grgmem.c
          This is a variant of pgplot/sys/grgmem.c that returns the pointer as
          an INTEGER*8 (64-bit-address).
pgplot/sys_sun4
     *.conf
          Changed shared library version number from 1.6 to 1.7.
pgplot/sys_vms
     grfileio.c
          Now recognizes file name ``-'' as standard output.
