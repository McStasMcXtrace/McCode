This is an extension for Tk800.015 and later which supplies
JPEG format loader for Photo image type.

This version builds with Mingw32 on Win32, and should build with
other "perl supported" Win32 compilers.

(Please use earlier Tk::JPEG 1.* with Tk40?.*)

The sub-directory jpeg is release 6a of the The Independent JPEG Group's (IJG)
free JPEG software with only the addition of a (dubious) Makefile.PL.

This package is not distributed with perl/Tk due to different portability
and licencing issues see jpeg/README for details of IJG's license.

This version uses Tk wrapper code based on the Img extension to Tcl/Tk.

The support for -data and passing options to read and write is incomplete.

The Makefile.PL in jpeg directory just invokes IJG's GNU-ish
'configure' script (on UNIX), and copies canned files into
place on Win32. Thus some hand intervention may be required.
Corrections to canned-file copying, and/or extension of that scheme
to use more of IJG's canned examples for other perl ports welcome.

That said :

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

Should build it.
