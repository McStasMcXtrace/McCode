=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Tk_Init> is the package initialization procedure for Tk.
It is normally invoked by the B<Tcl_AppInit> procedure
for an application or by the B<load> command.
B<Tk_Init> adds all of Tk's commands to I<interp>
and creates a new Tk application, including its main window.
If the initialization is successful B<Tk_Init> returns
B<TCL_OK>;  if there is an error it returns B<TCL_ERROR>.
B<Tk_Init> also leaves a result or error message
in I<interp-E<gt>result>.

If there is a variable B<argv> in I<interp>, B<Tk_Init>
treats the contents of this variable as a list of options for the
new Tk application.
The options may have any of the forms documented for the
B<wish> application (in fact, B<wish> uses Tk_Init to process
its command-line arguments).
