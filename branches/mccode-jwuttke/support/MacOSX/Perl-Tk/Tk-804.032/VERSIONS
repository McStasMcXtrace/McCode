This is Tk402.001

The name by the way is Tcl/Tk's 4.2 with three digits for me to mess with.

I hope Sun don't get through more than 100 revisions so two sub-version digits
will be enough for them.

I will subsume Sun's 'patch' stuff (e.g. '3' in 4.2p2) into my digits as we have
tended  to be 'ahead' of them on some fixes and behind on others so we don't
map exactly at that level.

For my digits I will use the 'even'=stable, 'odd'='experimental'
scheme that linux uses:

 .0xx  - inherently 'alpha'
 .1xx  - experimental 'beta'
 .2xx  - stable
 .3xx  - experimental
 .4xx  - stable
