I did use MakeMaker on ultrix to build tkperl. I changed the line in
Makefile.PL that reads:

'LIBS'    => ["$xlib -lX11 -lpt -lsocket -lnsl -lm"],

to read:

'LIBS'    => ["$xlib -lX11 -lpt -lsocket -lnsl -lm -ldnet"],

as we had a newer X11 in /usr/local that needed the DECnet protocol linking.
This was with Tk-b11 by the way.
