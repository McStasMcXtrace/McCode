This is a collection of Tixish widgets as well as a few other
miscellaneous widgets that I have found useful. They are distributed
under the same terms as Perl itself. Documentation for each widget
is embedded as a pod. Here is a brief one line description of each
one of the widgets:

BrowseEntry -- poor man's ComboBox; provides labeled entry with a button
               to popup choices.

NoteBook -- Display several pages within limited space using the notebook
            metaphor.

DialogBox -- Like Dialog but lets you add any widget to the top frame.

Balloon -- Balloon and status bar help message system.

LabFrame -- Labeled frame with "acrosstop" option.

To install:

perl Makefile.PL
make test
make install

You'll have to copy the files balArrow.xbm and cbxarrow.xbm to a
directory where Tk expects to find bitmaps.

Bug reports to rsi@earthling.net.

Enjoy.
