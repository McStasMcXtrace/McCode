\section{Lens\_parab\_Cyl: Thick 1D-parabolic CRL}
\label{s:lens-parab-cyl}
\index{Optics!lens}
\mcdoccomp{optics/Lens_parab_Cyl.parms}
This component is based on the same logical approach as the
\textbf{Lens\_parab} with one significant difference - geometrical surface.
Parabolic cylinder (parabolic curvature along the vertical axes only, invariant
along the horizontal) and thus ofocuses the beam in only in the vertical direction.

This component and its functionality is scheduled to be merged into \textbf{Lens\_parab}
