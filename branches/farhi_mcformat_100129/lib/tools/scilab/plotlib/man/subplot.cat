 SUBPLOT Create axes in tiled positions.
 
    subplot(m,n,p), breaks the Figure window
    into an m-by-n matrix of small axes and selects the p-th axes for
    for the current plot.  The axes
    are counted along the top row of the Figure window, then the
    second row, etc.  For example,

    t=linspace(0,2*%pi); 
    subplot(2,1,1); plot(t,cos(t)) 
    subplot(2,1,2); plot(t,sin(t)) 

    plots the cosinus on the top half of the window and the sinus on the
    bottom half.
