Installation on Mac OS X
------------------------

Last update to this file: Apr 10th 2006

Should be the same as for generic UNIX if libcpgplot and libpgplot are installed in 
'the usual places'

i.e.

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me
   make
   make test
   sudo make install

This will then be installed in to something like /Library/Perl/5.8.6/...

I compile the pgplot libs with gfortran 4.0 and everything worked smoothly (except for some
device drivers I didn't need) after some fiddling.

Note if pgplot includes the Aquaterm driver you will need to add the following by hand
to the link step in the Makefile generated by Makefile.PL -

-lpng -laquaterm -Wl,-framework -Wl,Foundation

Sorry! One day maybe I can figure out how to autodetect this cleanly.
