README for McStas redistribution of plotlib for Scilab

The maintainer of the plotlib package for Scilab has
kindly allowed the McStas team to redistribute his code.

We will try to keep the contents of this directory in sync
with the current version of plotlib, available from

http://www.dma.utc.fr/~mottelet/myplot.html

The next version of the plotlib package will formally become 
an Open Source project by implementation of a BSD type
