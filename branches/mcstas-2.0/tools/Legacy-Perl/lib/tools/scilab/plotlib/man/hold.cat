 HOLD   Hold current graph.
 
    HOLD ON holds the current plot and all axis properties so that
    subsequent graphing commands add to the existing graph.
    HOLD OFF returns to the default mode whereby PLOT commands erase 
    the previous plots and reset all axis properties before drawing 
    new plots.
    HOLD, by itself, toggles the hold state.
