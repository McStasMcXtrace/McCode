The component {\bf Divergence\_monitor} is a two-dimensional monitor,
which resembles {\bf PSD\_Monitor}. As for this component,
the detector window is set
by the $x$ and $y$ input coordinates.
{\bf Divergence\_ monitor} is sensitive to the neutron divergence,
defined by
$\eta_{\rm h} = \tan^{-1}(v_x/v_z)$ and $\eta_{\rm v} = \tan^{-1}(v_y/v_z)$.
The neutron counts are being histogrammed
into $n_{\rm v} \times n_{\rm h}$ pixels. 
The divergence range accepted is in the vertical direction
$[-\eta_{\rm v,max}; \eta_{\rm v,max}]$, and similar for the horizontal
direction.

The output from {\bf PSD\_monitor} is the integrated counts, $n, I, M_2$,
as well as
three two-dimensional arrays of counts: $n(\eta_{\rm v},\eta_{\rm h}),
I(\eta_{\rm v},\eta_{\rm h}), M_2(\eta_{\rm v},\eta_{\rm h})$.
The arrays are written to a file, \verb+filename+, 
and can be read e.g. by the tool {\bf MC\_plot}, see the system manual.
