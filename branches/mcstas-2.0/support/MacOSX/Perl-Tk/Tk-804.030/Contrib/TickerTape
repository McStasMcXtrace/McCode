TickerTape - Display long message in Tk

=head1 SYNOPSIS

TickerTape Message

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For everyone with a case of Browser envy after using Microsoft's Internet
Explorer, here's a perl/tk script only slightly more useful than a script
to do <BLINK>. Don't know why I wrote it. Don't know why you'd run it.
Maybe if you were writing a ticker tape application. Or had a weird thing
for Times Square. Anyway....
