*
* A geometric shape without effect on X-raysX, for instrument display purpose.
*
* %Description
* An inactive geometrical shape, for drawing purposes only.
* It does not propagate X-rays, nor interact.
* <b>Shape:</b>
* Geometric shape may be a cylinder, a sphere, a box or any other shape
*   box/plate:       xwidth x yheight x zdepth (thickness=0)
*   hollow box/plate:xwidth x yheight x zdepth and thickness>0
*   cylinder:        radius x yheight (thickness=0)
*   hollow cylinder: radius x yheight and thickness>0
*   sphere:          radius (yheight=0 thickness=0)
*   hollow sphere:   radius and thickness>0 (yheight=0)
*   any shape:       geometry=OFF file
*
*   The complex geometry option handles any closed non-convex polyhedra.
*   It computes the intersection points of the X ray with the object
*   transparently, so that it can be used like a regular sample object.
*   It supports the OFF and NOFF file format but not COFF (colored faces).
*   Such files may be generated from XYZ data using qhull/powercrust, and
*   viewed with geomview
*   The default size of the object depends of the OFF file data, but its
*   bounding box may be resized using xwidth,yheight and zdepth.
*
* Example: Shape(radius=0.05, yheight=0.1)
*          Shape(geometry="socket.off")
*
* %Parameters
* INPUT PARAMETERS:
* radius: [m]      Outer radius of sample in (x,z) plane 
* xwidth: [m]      Horiz. dimension of sample (bounding box if off file), as a width 
* yheight: [m]     Vert.  dimension of sample (bounding box if off file), as a height. A sphere shape is used when 0 and radius is set 
* zdepth: [m]      Depth of sample (bounding box if off file) 
* thickness: [m]   Thickness of hollow sample 
* geometry: [str]  Name of an Object File Format (OFF) file for complex geometry. The OFF file may be generated from XYZ coordinates using qhull/powercrust 
* center: [1]      Flag to determine if OFF object is centered on its centre of mass.
