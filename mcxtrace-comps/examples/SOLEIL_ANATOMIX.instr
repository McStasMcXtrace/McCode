* The ANATOMIX tomography beam-line at Synchrotron SOLEIL.
*
* %D
* The beamline ANATOMIX (Advanced Nanotomography and Imaging with coherent X rays)
* works at photon energies between 5 and 50 keV. It is dedicated to full-field
* radiography and tomography in absorption and phase contrast, with pixel sizes
* from 20 nm to 20 Âµm.

* ANATOMIX is a beamline for X-ray tomography on the micro- and nanoscale, in
* absorption and phase contrast. It operates in the energy range from 5 keV upward
* and allows its users to obtain two- and three-dimensional radiographic images of
* bulk volume samples of macroscopic size (up to several cm thickness). For
* smaller samples, a spatial resolution down to 50 nm (20 nm pixel size) can be
* achieved. Real-time studies are possible at speeds of currently up to one
* microtomography scan per second; higher speeds up to 20 volume scans per second
* (50 ms per scan) have been demonstrated.

* A flexible sample interface enables in situ and/or operando studies under
* conditions similar to the natural or working environment of the samples
* (temperature, humidity, mechanical load, transport processes). Biological
* samples can be measured without dehydration and, in many cases, without chemical
* fixation. With suitable sample preparation, cellular imaging without cryogenic
* environment is possible.
*
* This is a simplified model with an Undulator, a double channel-cut monochromator,
* a sample stage and a detector. It models a parallel beam full field tomograph.
* The monochromator is an Si(111), the sample is made of Be. The sample is 2 cm
* wide.
*
* %Example: -n 1e5 E0=17 Detector: psd_monitor_after_cc_I=1.6e+08
*
* %P
* E0:    [keV] Energy selected at the Undulator.
* Emono: [keV] Energy selected at the monochromator. When 0, it is set to E0.
* dE:    [keV] Energy spread at the Undulator.
* ANGLE: [deg] Rotation angle of the sample stage.
* sample:[str] Sample geometry file, OFF/PLY format.
