.SH NAME
mcformat \- Text data set conversion/merging tool of the McStas neutron ray-trace simulation package
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mcformat [\-\-format=FORMAT] [file|dir ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mcformat
command is the text data conversion tool of the McStas package. It may convert any kind of McStas data into an other format. Additionally, it can
.I merge
equivalent data sets. These might be for instance two simulations made independently (e.g. on a grid or cluster) with the same instrument and parameters. The result will be as if the simulation was performed once on a single machine. The command can merge at the same time many data sets into families. When given directories as input, mcformat works recursively, and the resulting data set follows the same directory hierarchy as the input data sets.
.PP
.B McStas
is a general tool for simulating neutron scattering instruments and experiments. It is actively supported by
.I Risoe National Laboratory
and
.I ILL

.PP
McStas is based on a compiler [mcstas(1)] that reads a high-level specification language defining the instrument to be simulated and produces C code that performs the Monte Carlo Simulation. The system is very fast in use, both when setting up the instrument definition and when doing calculations.
.PP
McStas supports all neutron scattering instruments, including triple-axis,  time-of-flight instruments, and polarised neutrons. It comes with a comprehensive manual and a library of well-tested components that include most standard elements of neutron scattering instruments, including steady-state and pulsed sources, monochromators/analysers, guides, collimators, vanadium and powder samples, velocity selectors and choppers, and a variety of detectors.
.PP
The package consists of the following user commands:
.TP
mcgui(1)
is the graphical user interface. Then use the
.I Neutron Site
menu to select an example instrument, and access the whole documentation for the
.I Help
menu. It contains an instrument editor, methods to plot simulation results, and much more
.TP
mcrun(1)
is the command-line tool for building and running simulations
.TP
mcplot(1)
is the simulation results plotting tool
.TP
mcdisplay(1)
is the instrument geometry and neutron trajectory viewer
.TP
mcdoc(1)
is the documentation tool
.TP
mcstas(1)
is the instrument compiler
.TP
.B mcformat(1)
can transform any text data set from one format to an other. It does not support conversion from binary data sets. It can also merge equivalent results.
.PP
We encourage users to refer to the User and Component Manuals, which are available with the command
.B
mcdoc

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-\-format=FORMAT
Specifies wanted output format, i.e. PGPLOT, Matlab, Scilab, HTML, XML, IDL, VRML, Python, Octave, ...
.TP
\-d DIR | \-\-dir=DIR
Put all data files in directory DIR.
.TP
\-f FILE | \-\-file=FILE
Put all data in a single file.
.TP
\-a | \-\-data-only
Do not put any headers in the data files.
.TP
\-\-no-output-files | \-t | \-\-test
Do not write any data files (test mode).
.TP
\-h | \-\-help
Show the command help.
.TP
\-c | \-\-force
Force writting in existing directories and enable relaxed merging mode (no name check). Use with caution !
.TP
\-m | \-\-merge
Add/Append equivalent data files and lists
.TP
\-s | \-\-scan
Gather simulations per scan series (and merge equivalent data sets)
.TP
\-so | \-\-scan-only
Create scan series but does not merge data
.TP
\-\-verbose
Verbose mode

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Typical usage (put translated files in outdir)
.B mcformat
indir -d outdir
.TP
Merge two equivalent simulations dir1 and dir2 into dir3
mcformat \-\-format=Matlab dir1 dir2 -d dir3
.SH BUGS
mcformat can only handle text data sets. Data sets generated with binary files can not be translated.
.PP
Additionally, as mcformat works by identification of specific keywords in each data file, if these keywords match some file or component names, the meta data used to identify the simulation might be guessed wrong. Anyway, the data set will still be exact.
