# Install McXtrace 3.2 on Linux and Unix.

* We provide Debian packages, RedHat packages, and tar.gz's of "preconfigured" source code.

## The repo way
The preferred way of installing on Debian/Ubuntu or CentOS
7 type systems is by adding our respective **deb** or **rpm** repository!!! Please consult the
specific [Debian/Ubuntu](debian/README.md) or  [CentOS](centos/README.md).

## The non-repo way
* Other systems like [Fedora](fedora/README.md) are also supported, but without an rpm repository. 

## Favorite system not available?
* For other systems, please either
 * Use the instructions for
 [pre-configured source code](src/README.md)
 * Build directly from the repo [build instructions](https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki/Building-McStas-McXtrace)
 * You are welcome to contact us in case of issues, e.g. via [mcxtrace-users](mailto:mcxtrace-users@mcxtrace.org)
