# Install McXtrace 3.5.12 on Linux and Unix.

* We provide Debian packages, RedHat packages, and tar.gz's of "preconfigured" source code.

## Official Debian packages
We are currently in transition to provide McXtrace via the official Debian repository, see [packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=mcxtrace&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all)

Until McXtrace is broadly available in Debian/Ubuntu, you may also use our own mccode.org packages:

## Our own Debian packages
Please consult the specific [Debian/Ubuntu](debian/README.md).

## Other Linux
As of 3.5.12 we no longer build for RPM based systems. Please use our [conda-forge](../conda/README.md) packages instead.

## Favorite system not available?
* For other systems, please build directly from the repo [build instructions](https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki/Building-McXtrace-McXtrace)
 * You are welcome to contact us in case of issues, e.g. via [mcxtrace-users](mailto:mcxtrace-users@mcxtrace.org)
