## Install McXtrace 1.5 On Debian class systems (including Ubuntu, mint etc.):

# Add the McCode repository
After following the below steps your package manager should now be aware of mcxtrace
```bash
cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
sudo wget http://packages.mccode.org/debian/mccode.list
sudo apt-get update
```

# Debian only:
On Debian you will further have to install the non-free repository to have access to all McXtrace tool parts. See https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList

# The easiest way:
The meta-packages *mcxtrace-suite-perl* and *mcxtrace-suite-python* allow you to install mcxtrace with one or both sets of tools (mcrun/mcplot etc.) by simple apt-get commands like
```bash
sudo apt-get install mcxtrace-suite-python
```
For the legacy perl tools just replace python with perl.

# Look for McXtrace packages to install
```bash
mcxtrace@debian:~$ apt-cache search mcxtrace | grep 1.5
