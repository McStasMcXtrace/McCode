* Hot neutron three-axis spectrometer IN1@ILL
*
* %Description
* IN8 is installed on beamtube H10 (diameter F = 200 mm).
*
* IN1 works in a time-sharing mode. This means that the same monochromator is
* also used by the Be-filter spectrometer IN1-BeF and by the liquids
* diffractometer D4. Changing over between the three different instruments can be
* done without difficulty in about two hours.
*
* The monochromator unit carries three different vertically focussing
* monochromators built from copper single crystals (available reflecting planes
* Cu(200), Cu(220) and Cu(331)). The exchange of the monochromator planes is
* controlled by the instrument computer. The radius of curvature can be
* automatically adjusted as function of reflected energy in order to maintain
* maximal flux at the sample position in the course of energy scans. The
* scattering angles on the monochromator cover a range of 10<2theta_m <90  
* allowing for scanning neutron energies from 13 meV to more than 1 eV..
*
* The IN1-TAS spectrometer: the scattering angles at the sample and the analyser
* can be changed in the intervals -115<2theta_S<115 and -120<2theta_S<120. Three
* different analysers (PG(002), Cu(200), Cu(220)) can be installed in order to
* optimise intensity and resolution for a given experiment. Various resonance
* absorption filters (e.g. Er, Sm, Hf ...) can be used to suppress higher order
* contaminations from the incident beam or in the scattered beam. An oriented
* Pyrolytic Graphite filter is designed for experiments eventually demanding
* thermal neutron energy range.
*
* In this TAS configuration, Cu220 are used as monochromator and analyser, 
* with a single type detector.
