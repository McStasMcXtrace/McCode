This is McStas version 1.6.1-beta, released February 18th, 2002.
Copyright (C) Risoe National Laboratory, 1997-2002. All rights reserved.
See the file LICENSE for conditions on use.
Since simulations produced with McStas will include code from the files
in the lib/ directory, such simulations are derived works of these
files. For this reason, a less restrictive licence applies to these
files only, see the file lib/LICENSE.LIB.
Finally, the random number algorithm used by default in McStas is the
"Mersenne Twister", by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura (see
http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/emt.html). This code is included in
the file lib/mcstas-r.c and is distributed under the terms of the GNU
Library General Public License, see the file lib/LGPL.

If you wish to use McStas in ways that contradict the conditions,
contact us and chances are that we will be able to make a suitable
arrangement.

Installation instructions are in the file INSTALL.

Changes from previous versions are in the file CHANGES. Please read that !

To get started, some example instrument definitions have been supplied
in the examples/ directory. To run a simulation, the command `mcrun' is
used. For example:

    mcrun prisma2 -n2e6 TT=-30 PHA=22 PHA1=-3 PHA2=-2 PHA3=-1 PHA4=0 PHA5=1 PHA6=2 PHA7=3 TTA=44

This will first compile the instrument definition (if necessary) and
subsequently run it. It is also possible to run simulations from the
graphical user interface `mcgui', or to compile and run simulations
manually.

The output files will be put in the current directory by default. The
file tas1-scans in the example directory is a script that will run a
series of simulations that constitute a line-up experiment of the TAS1
spectrometer at Risø.

To fully utilize McStas, you will need a copy of the McStas manual. If
you received McStas on CDROM, the manual will be included as a
postscript file. The manual, along with much other information, is also
available from the McStas WWW home page:

    http://neutron.risoe.dk/mcstas/
      and
    http://www.ill.fr/tas/mcstas/

Feel free to direct any comments or questions
to this address. It is an important goal of the McStas project to have
the program used also outside of Risø, so if you have a reasonable
request there is a good chance that we will be willing to help you out.

Some parts of McStas require additional software to be installed in
order to work. The needed software packages are all freely
distributable, and can be found on the McStas WWW home page or on the
McStas CD-Rom distribution.
