This is McStas version 1.1, released March 31, 1999.
Copyright (C) Risoe National Laboratory, 1997-1999. All rights reserved.
See the file LICENSE for conditions on use.
Since simulations produced with McStas will include code from the files
in the lib/ directory, such simulations are derived works of these
files. For this reason, a less restrictive licence applies to these
files only, see the file lib/LICENSE.LIB.

If you wish to use McStas in ways that contradict the conditions,
contact us and chances are that we will be able to make a suitable
arrangement.

Installation instructions are in the file INSTALL.

To get started, some example instrument definitions have been supplied
in the examples/ directory. To compile an instrument, first run the
McStas compiler, eg.

    mcstas prisma2.instr

and then run the C compiler on the resulting C file, eg.

    cc -o prisma2 prisma2.c -lm

To run the simulation, type eg.

    ./prisma2 -n2e6 TT=-30 PHA=22 PHA1=-3 PHA2=-2 PHA3=-1 PHA4=0 PHA5=1 PHA6=2 PHA7=3 TTA=44

The output files will be put in the current directory by default. The
file tas1-scans in the example directory is a script that will run a
series of simulations that constitute a line-up experiment of the TAS1
spectrometer at Risø.

To fully utilize McStas, you will need a copy of the McStas manual. If
you received McStas on CDROM, the manual will be included as a
postscript file. The manual, along with much other information, is also
available from the McStas WWW home page:

The contact for McStas is Kristian Nielsen, email
kristian.nielsen@risoe.dk. Feel free to direct any comments or questions
to this address. It is an important goal of the McStas project to have
the program used also outside of Risø, so if you have a reasonable
request there is a good chance that we will be willing to help you out.

Some parts of McStas require additional software to be installed in
order to work. The needed software packages are all freely
distributable, and can be found on the McStas WWW home page or on the
McStas CD-Rom distribution.
