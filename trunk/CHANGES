Changes in McStas v1.7, Jan 17, 2003

  Kernel (i.e. the 'mcstas' program)
  - components may have a SHARE section, which is imported only once per type
    of component. It has the same role as DECLARE, but only once.
  - the component files may have some %include inside '%{ }%' C DECLARE or SHARE
    blocks. The files to include are searched locally, and then in the library.
    If an extension is found, just the specified file is included, else both 
    .h and .c are embedded if the --no-runtime has not been specified.
    The instrument files can also embed external files, both in C blocks 
    and in the instrument parts (DECLARE, etc...) as in previous releases.
  - The instrument and components may have char* setting parameters. For
    instruments, their length is limited to 1024 chars.
  - The FINALLY section, that was executed at the end, has been split into 
    still the FINALLY, and a new SAVE section. This latter is executed
    at simulation end (just before the FINALLY), but also each time an
    intermediate save is required (e.g. a 'kill -USR2 <pid>' is used).
  - An instrument source file may contain EXTEND %{ }% C blocks just after  
    the usual AT...ROTATED.. keywords, to extend the behaviour of existing
    components, without touching their code. All local component variables are 
    available. This may for instance be used to add a new 'color' to neutrons, 
    i.e. assign a new characteristic variable to the neutron.
  - component instances in an instrument source file may be GROUPed into 
    exclusive assembly, i.e. only one component of the group will intercept
    neutron, the rest will be skipped. This is usefull for multi monochromators
    multi detectors, multiple collimators, ... This is a kind if splitting.
  - McStas can now compile for Windows without troubles (if lex/yacc files
    were generated elsewere, or using the flex/yacc for Windows)

  Run-time library (e.g. the instrument program)
  - A global gravitation handling is now available, by setting the -g flag
  - many output formats are available for data. use the --format="format"
    flag, e.g. --format="Scilab". The full list is displayed with
    the -h flag for the instrument program. 
    example: 
      mcrun test.instr --format="Matlab binary" -n 1e4
    will create a mcstas.m file. Launch Matlab and execute
      s=mcstas('plot')  % will import data into s, and plot all detectors.
    Binary formats are handled by IDL, Matlab, Scilab.
    The present available format list is
      "McStas" "Scilab" "Matlab" "IDL" "XML" "HTML" 
    The default format is McStas/PGPLOT, but may be specified globally using
    the MCSTAS_FORMAT environment variable
  - It is possible to save 3D data arrays, by calling the DETECTOR_OUT_3D macro.
    (handled as 2D by mcplot)
  - The type of the 'number of events' array in monitors was changed from int to
    double, to avoid overflow. Please update your home-made monitors.
  - many dedicated libraries are now available as shared code for reading
    tables, handling data trees and monitors. These are C functions to be
    %included into components (see e.g. lib/monitors/Monitor_nD.comp)
  - The USR2 signal generates an intermediate save for all monitors, during
    the simulation (execute the SAVE section). The USR1 still give informations.
  - a new randvec_target_rect function now focuses on a rectangle
    (more efficient than former randvec_target_sphere=randvec_target_circle)

  Components (in the lib directory)
  - a new data directory contains neutron data tables
  - obsolete directory contains components that were renamed or old.
  - misc/Progress_bar component now exists, and may save data regularly.
  - optics/Monochromator_curved can read reflectivity and transmission tables
  - monitors/Monitor_nD can have automatic limits mode for either all or 
    selected monitored variables. It may also plot banana monitors for mcdisplay
    and trigger intermediate savings for all monitors (same as USR2 sig.)
    Also, it may monitor something else than the intensity, e.g. the mean
    energy on a XY psd.
  - sources/Virtual_output can save all neutron events into a file
    (beware the size of the generated files !). Format may be text and binary
  - sources/Virtual_input can read the files generated by Virtual_output
  - optics/Guide_gravity can handle a 2D array of channels
  - optics/Filter_gen can read a table from a file and affect the neutron beam
    (replaces the obsolete 'Flux_adapter'). It may act as a filter or a source
  - samples: they now can all target towards any component, giving its index 
    (no need to compute target_x/y/z vector, use e.g. target_index=+1)
  - samples/Res_monitor, Powder1 and V_sample may now have a sphere or box
    shape, and may focus to a circular or rectangular area

  Tools
  - Matlab, Scilab and IDL may read directly McStas results if the simulation
    was executed with the --format="..." option (see 'Run-time' changes)
  - mcplot, mcdisplay, mcgui are now less dependent on the perl/pgplot installed
    versions.
  - mcplot can plot a single simulation data file
  - mcplot, mcresplot, mcdisplay can output gif, ps and ps color. They also
    have integrated help (-h options), and may generate output files in a
    non interactive mode (read file, create output file, exit)
  - mcplot and mcdisplay work with Matlab, PGPLOT and Scilab plotters (set with
    the MCSTAS_FORMAT default setting, or -pPLOTTER, or PGPLOT if not set)
  - mcrun can not currently generate scan results in other formats than McStas
  - mcsats2vitess works now ok for converting a McStas component to a Vitess one  


Changes in McStas v1.6.1 (beta), Feb 18th, 2002.

 - a bug was corrected for very small signal statistics automatic limits
   search in Monitor_nD (0.16.4), that could cause parasitc peaks and
   fluctuations in detector.
   
 - 'optics' components were renamed by categories, starting with Guide_...,
   Monochromator_..., Filter_... etc so that sorting is easier.
   
 - Monochromator_2foc and Monochromator_curved can now read a reflectivity table
   file (eg. PG) with rows [k, R]. Both components give the same results, and
   can use the same parameters.
   
 - mcplot can now read a list of detector files, without a '.sim' file. This 
   enables to visualise a set of selected monitors, or may be used when the 
   mcstas.sim file was deleted. Detector files must be in current directory.
   
 - the 1D and 2D detectors now compute simple signal statistics (min, max, mean,
   center and width of distributions) which are stored in the detector file
   and shown in plots (mcplot).
   
 - The Virtual_input replaces the Source_file component (see below), and can 
   read text, Vitess and binary float files of neutron events.

Changes in McStas v1.6-ill (alpha), October 29th, 2001.

 - In component definitions, a SHARE keyword followed by a C code block  
   %{...}% acts the same as a DECLARE block, but is only included once in an
   instrument. This is very useful when using many identical components
   (guides, monitors, monochromators) to speed-up compiling and perfomrnaces.
     SHARE 
     %{ /* included only once for all identical components */
     %}
     DECLARE
     %{ /* included for all components */
     %}
   Then all component programmers may add C functions to the 'kernel'. This is
   only worth when you plan to use a given component many times in a simulation
   (e.g. not for sources or samples). To downgrade a McStas 1.5 component, just
   move the SHARE block C code into the DECLARE block. 
 - In an instrument definition, within the TRACE section, each COMPONENT 
   instance may include a C code block:
     COMPONENT Comp1 = Guide(...)
     AT (...) ROTATED (...)
     EXTEND 
     %{ /* some C code to execute after component Comp1 */
        /* in current coordinate system. You may use Comp1 and global */
        /* instrument variables */
     %}
   For instance, you can here give a 'color' (additional neutron    
   characteristic) and modify next components behaviours.
   This block is always executed in groups, but you can test if the componnet
   intercepted the neutron with the SCATTERED variable (if (SCATTERED) { ... }).
 - In an instrument TRACE section, it is possible to put a set of component
   in an exclusive group. Only one of the elements of the group can act on
   the neutron. If no element acts on the neutron, it is absorbed.
   This is specially useful for multi-detectors, multi-monochromators in 
   parallel, multiple collimators/guides (e.g. radial).
     COMPONENT Comp1 = Guide(...)
     AT (...) ROTATED (...) GROUP MyGroupName
     
     COMPONENT Comp2 = Guide(...)
     AT (...) ROTATED (...) GROUP MyGroupName
   Comp1 and Comp2 may even be at the same place. 
   For programmers: it is important that the component TRACE section contains a
   SCATTER keyword when it successfully intercepts it, to tell McStas that a
   component in a group acts on a neutron, and can skip other comp in the group.
 - In 'mcplot', it is possible to use the -ps, -psc and -gif options to
   generate a PS, color PS, and GIF file, and exit mcplot (no display).
 - The Monitor_nD was upgraded to correct bugs when reaching the component
   (the propagation was not performed correctly in some cases), and the disk/
   sphere radius (monitor remained then squared). This component now uses
   the SHARE block. A bug was corrected for lists. It can output log and abs of
   signals, and source files (see Source_file).
 - The Gravity_guide now handles correctly the focusing multichannel guides.
   Gravitation is included (on y axis). This component now uses the SHARE block.
   The Channeled_guide does not handle properly the focusing multichannels.
 - The Source_gen component focuses uniformly on the target, and can model
   rectangular, disk, gaussian, and Maxwellian (up to 3 distributions) sources. 
   Previous source components did not focus correctly on the target. They were 
   also corrected, execpt the 'Source_Maxwell'. Source_gen can replace all thee
   previous sources.
 - A new Source_file component can take as input a text file containing an
   array with columns ' x y z vx vy vz t sx sy sz p', such as the data files
   generated from Monitor_nD with options="list all source". The source may
   be re-generated more than once, which is useful to improve accuracy,
   specially when further components do MC choices. Vitess files and float
   binary files are also ok (auto-recognition of format).
 - The signal handler now gives more info about where a signal was caught.
   For instance it tells in which component part an error occured, to make
   debuging easier.
   Usefull Signals: kill -Signal <pid>
      -USR1: display info and continue simulation
      -USR2: finish simulation and save results
      -QUIT: end simulation immediately
 - The 2D detectors now also output the errors/counts on signal as 1D detectors.
   Set p2=NULL in DETECTOR_OUT_2D to unactivate error saving in components.
 - We tried to lower the number of components by merging similar ones. 
 - There are now new MACROS for the component programmer.
     * mccompcurindex is the number (index) of the current component 
       (1 is first component of instrument)
     * RESTORE_NEUTRON(index, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, t, sx, sy, sz, p)
       restores the neutron state to the one at the input of the component
       'index'. To ignore a component effect, use
       RESTORE_NEUTRON(mccompcurindex, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, t, sx, sy, sz, p)
       at the end of its TRACE section, or in its THEN section.
       These neutron states are in the local component coordinate systems.
     * STORE_NEUTRON(index, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, t, sx, sy, sz, p)
       stores the current neutron state in the trace-history table, in local
       coordinate system. This is automatically done when entering each
       component of an instrument.
     * POS_A_COMP_INDEX(index) is the absolute position of component
       'index'. POS_A_COMP_INDEX(mccompcurindex) is the same as
       POS_A_CURRENT_COMP. You may use POS_A_COMP_INDEX(mccompcurindex+1) to
       make, for instance, your component access the position of the next
       component (this is usefull for automatic targeting).
     * SCATTERED is non zero when previous component acted on neutron (let pass
       or scatter)
       
   Warning: programmers, do not use anymore the 'mccompcurname' when writing
   your components. rather use the 'NAME_CURRENT_COMP'.
       
   Other minor modifications    
   #cleaned up non used variables in mcstas-r.c/h
   #tested and corrected components
        misc: Vitess_input/output: included Spin from Vitess. (vitess-lib.c/h)
          but can not be used as mcstas can not find vitess-lib.c/h. I included
          what was needed in SHARE sections. now works OK.
        samples:
            Single_crystal (now can take lattice angles, forgot a %} at SHARE
              end) 
            provide *.dat diffraction samples from Crystallographica
        optics:
            Beamstop now is a merging of Beamstop_circular and 
              Beamstop_rectangular (using default  values to select shape)
            Channeled_guide: now output an error in multichannel focusing mode.
            Chopper: determined default values to have lambda~4 AA. Can handle
              First_Chopper (parameter IsFirst)
            Fermi_Chopper : default values for transmission every ~2 AA
            Gravity_guide: limit loops to max of 1000 bounces for each 
              components (to avoid endless loops)
            Mosaic_anisotropic: can take DM (d-spacing). default for graphite.
            Powder_filter (did not work at all, now can take lattice angles, 
              also works as a sample, can take samples/*.dat diffraction files)
            Selector: default values for transmission at ~4 AA
            Slit: now is a merging of Slit and Circular_slit (using default
              values to select shape)
            Soller: can take transmission
            V_selector: default values for transmission at ~4 AA
        sources
            Source_gen: can handle all previous sources in one component (up to
              3 Maxwellians). Corrected homogeneity bug for illumination.
            Source_file: can read 'source' files from Vitess, text files (both 
              90 bytes/neutron) and float binary  files (e.g, from Monitor_nD 
              with options="list all, source binary" which is more compact in  
              size, 48  bytes/neutron). Autorecognition of the format. The MCNP 
              output is not fixed. Just tell MCNP  guys to output the float 
              binary or text file.

Changes in McStas v1.5, October, 10th, 2001

Modified components 
      A corrected version of Arm.comp. For further information, see the emails by Ulrich
      Wildgruber and Stuart Rycroft. (Apr. 26, 2001) 
      A corrected version of  Monitor_nD.comp. For further information, see the email by
      Emmanuel Farhi. (Apr. 26, 2001) 
      A rewritten version of Gravity_guide.comp has been contributed by Emmanuel Farhi
      (see email). The component provided in the email works with McStas 1.4.2, but the official
      version of the component is not working with McStas 1.4.2 because support for this
      component has been added to the kernel. (Aug. 7, 2001) 
      An updated version of Monitor_nD.comp has been contributed by Emmanuel Farhi (see
      first and second email). The new version of the component is not working with McStas
      1.4.2 because support for the component has been added to the kernel. (Aug. 8, 2001) 
      Andrew Wildes and Emmanuel Farhi have detected an error when using focusing
      geometry in Channeled_guide. The slope of the channels is not computed corrected
      correctly, because the same left and right slopes are used in all channels. This has now
      been included properly in Gravity_guide, and it is recommended that this component is
      used. (Sep. 18, 2001) 
      The handling of illumination in Source_flat, Source_div and Source_flat_lambda have
      been corrected. (Oct. 9, 2001) 
  New components 
      The He3_cell.comp has been contributed by Trefor Roberts. It models a cylindrical 3He
      spin filter cell. (Aug. 8, 2001) 
      The Mon_2foc.comp has been contributed by Peter Link. It models a double bent
      monochromator with multiple slabs. (Aug. 9, 2001) 
      The Bender.comp has been contributed by Philipp Bernhardt. It models a curved neutron
      guide. (Aug. 10, 2001) 
      The Powder_filter.comp has been contributed by Ben Fortescue. It models a general
      box-shaped powder filter. (Aug. 16, 2001) 
      The Source_Maxwell_3 component describes a source with three Maxwellian
      distributions. (Sep. 17, 2001) 
      Various monitors have been added: EPSD_monitor, PSDcyl_monitor, PSDlin_monitor,
      TOF_cylPSD_monitor, TOFlog_mon. (Sep. 18, 2001) 
          A minor error in TOF_cylPSD_monitor has been corrected. (Oct. 9, 2001) 
      A new monitor TOFLambda_monitor has been added. (Oct. 9, 2001) 
      A guide modeling waviness, Guide_wavy, has been added. (Oct. 9, 2001) 
      A generic source, Source_gen, has been added. (Oct. 10, 2001) 
  The signal handling system has been updated to handle a special case. The signal handling
  system will be documented in the manual of version 1.5. (Aug. 7, 2001) 
  The representation of polarisation in McStas components and instruments is supposed to work
  as follows. Only components actually modifying the spin explicitly require the "POLARISATION
  PARAMETERS (sx,sy,sz)" line. An instrument handling polarisation may consist of  components
  both with and without this line; it will transform the spin vector correctly anyway. The 
  "POLARISATION PARAMETERS (sx,sy,sz)" line is therefore removed from all official
  components not dealing with polarisation. The reason is that for instruments without polarisation
  some simulation time is gained by excluding the transformations of the spin vector. (Aug. 9,
  2001) 
  Some definitions have been added that can be used in coding components: 
      NAME_CURRENT_COMP gives the name of the current component as a string. (Aug.
      16, 2001) 
      POS_A_CURRENT_COMP gives the absolute position of the current component. A
      component of the vector is referred to as POS_A_CURRENT_COMP.i where i is x, y or z.
      (Aug. 16, 2001) 
      ROT_A_CURRENT_COMP and  ROT_R_CURRENT_COMP give the orientation of the
      current component as rotation matrices (absolute orientation and the orientation relative to
      the previous component, respectively). A component of  a rotation matrice is referred to
      as  ROT_A_CURRENT_COMP[m][n], where m and n are 0, 1, or 2. (Aug. 16, 2001) 
      POS_A_COMP(comp) gives the absolute position of the component with the name
      comp. Note that comp is not given as a string. A component of the vector is referred to as
      POS_A_COMP(comp).i where i is x, y or z. (Aug. 16, 2001) 
      ROT_A_COMP(comp) and ROT_R_COMP(comp)  give the orientation of the
      component comp as rotation matrices (absolute orientation and the orientation relative to
      its previous component, respectively). Note that comp is not given as a string. A
      component of  a rotation matrice is referred to as  ROT_A_COMP(comp)[m][n], where
      m and n are 0, 1, or 2. (Aug. 16, 2001)
