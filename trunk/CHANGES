Changes in McStas v1.4, July 28, 2000:

 - It is now possible to use arbitrary C expressions in the instrument
   definition, ie. to set rotations, component parameters, etc. Only
   works for SETTING parameters though, not DEFINITION parameters.
 - Experimental mcstas2vitess conversion program to automatically
   translate a McStas component into a VITESS module.
 - Option to clear the simulation output in mcgui.
 - Partial solution to the problem with name conflicts on component
   parameters.
 - Partial NeXus support implemented, but not yet functional.
 - Misc. minor bug fixes.



Changes in McStas v1.3, May 18, 2000:

 - New facility `McDoc' for documentation of components, with
   automatic extraction of documentation from comment headers in the
   source code.
 - The possibility in the graphical user interface `mcgui' to build
   instrument definitions using "point-and-click", based on McDoc.
 - Much improved `mcrun' front-end, which now replaces the old `gscan'
   front-end and interfaces with `mcplot'.
 - Optional component input parameters.
 - Instrument parameters may now also be of string type.
 - Improved Single_crystal component, now supports anisotropic mosaic,
   multiple scattering, extinction, absorbtion, and incoherent
   scattering.
 - New components Source_Optimizer and Monitor-nD, by Emmanuel Farhi.
 - Misc. minor bug fixes.



Changes in McStas v1.2, January 31, 2000:

 - New components (Single_crystal, Mosaic_simple, Source_adapt,
   Res_sample, ...).
 - New graphical user interface mcgui.
 - New command-line front-end mcrun with automatic compilation
   (experimental).
 - New resolution function front-end mcresplot (experimental).
 - Better random number generator "Mersenne Twister".
 - Fix for problem with Digital Unix almost-ANSI compiler.
 - Misc. minor bug fixes.



Changes in McStas v1.1, March 31, 1999:

 - New components.
 - Much improved output file format, with new mcplot front-end to
   automatically plot the results of a simulation.
 - New MCDISPLAY sections in component definitions, and much improved
   mcdisplay front-end.
 - New kernel calls DETECTOR_OUT_[012]D(), mcget_ncount().
 - Improved error messages.
 - New --portable compiler option.
 - Various minor bug and compatibility fixes.
 - Preliminary support for polarised neutrons.
 - Quote special characters in strings in the generated C code.



Changes in McStas v1.0, October 26, 1998:

 - Initial release.
