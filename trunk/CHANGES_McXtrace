CHANGES from 1.0

- Packaging completely redone. We now use cmake instead of GNU autotools. Thus the steps to build mcxtrace from source are
now altered (see below)
  - Binary packages are now provided as a suite of package files, instead of a single file. This has a few implications:
1. Bugs in the component library may be fixed more quickly as the component library may be updated independently
2. Users not needing a GUI are not bothered with installing supporting libraries
3. Users may replace the perl mxrun.pl with a new (experimental) python based version mxrun.py with additional features such as 2d-scans
4. More than one version of mcxtrace may be present on the same system, with some caveats
In the general the packages files are named as:
   - mcxtrace, contains code generator and runtime codes
     * Dependencies: a C-compiler (and mcxtrace-comps)
     * Optional: an MPI environment
   - mcxtrace-comps, contains component- and instrument example libraries 
     * Dependencies: mcxtrace
   - mcxtrace-tools-Perl, contains our "legacy" set of perl tools 
     * Dependencies: mcxtrace, Perl, Perl::Tk, pgplot, perl-PGPLOT, Gnuplot
     * Optional: Perl::Tk::CodeText, Perl::Math::Amoeba, Matlab, a VRML-viewer, (Scilab 4.0)
     * Remark: As far as possible, we provide dependencies in the installation bundles
     * Remark: mcgui can be configured to run python-based tools for sub-tasks
   - mcxtrace-doc, contains our PDF manuals
   - mcxtrace-tools-Python-mxrun, contains our new, python-based compile/run script
     * Dependencies: python-yaml
     * Remark: The script falls back to the perl version if dependencies do not resolve
   - mcxtrace-tools-Python-mxplot-matplotlib, contains a new matplotlib mcplot solution
     * Dependencies: python-matplotlib
     * Remark: A bit on the slow side for large datasets
     * Remark: Features zooming on individual plots
     * Remark: "Standard" mcplot shortcuts for graphics dumps etc.
     * Remark: Recommendations for platform-specific python-distributions below
     * Remark: The script falls back to the perl version if dependencies do not resolve
   - mcxtrace-tools-Python-mxplot-chaco, contains a draft implementation of mcplot based on chaco
     * Dependencies: python-chaco
     * Remark: Faster than matplotlib-solution, but a bit on the slow side for large datasets
     * Remark: Features zooming on individual plots
     * Remark: Recommendations for platform-specific python-distributions below
     * Remark: Not easy to install dependencies for chaco if not in your python distro
     * Remark: The script falls back to the perl version if dependencies do not resolve

The recommended order of installation is
mcxtrace, mcxtrace-comps, mcxtrace-tools-Perl, 
and then optionally
mcxtrace-tools-Python-mxrun and/or  mcxtrace-tools-Python-mxplot-matplotlib or mcxtrace-tools-Python-mxplot-chaco.

- STATE PARAMETERS line is now obsolete and is ignored with a warning
Instead the state parameter vector is _always_ (x,y,z, kx,ky,kz, t, phi, Ex,Ey,Ez, p) inside
all components.
 
INSTALLATION instructions

WINDOWS:
1. Download the Windows executable installation file appropriate for your system (32 or 64 bit)
2. Install first kernel packages followed by component library (mctrace, mcxtrace-comps)
--additional steps for GUI and plotting tools
3. Make sure your system has perl installed. We recommend strawberry perl (www.strawberryperl.com) as the distribution includes the necessary perl modules to run McXtrace.
It alsos includes a port of gcc - so you do not need to install a c-compiler separately if you do not want to do so.
4. Install the mcxtrace-tools-perl package. 
--optional steps to get the epxerimental python based tools
5. Install a python distribution. We recommend PythonXY (http://www.pythonxy.com) or Anaconda CE (http://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda).
6. Install wanted python packages. The python tools will use the old perl tools as a fallback in case of a missing dependency package 
  
MAC-OSX:
1. Download the appropriate Mac OS installer bundle
2. Unpack it
3. Install the supporting packages: PDL and Tk-bundle
4. Install McXtrace (kernel, component, tools - in that order) using the installer packages as you would usually.

DEBIAN-based systems:
1. Untar the package tarball and cd into the directory
2. Install kernel, components and optionally tools packages (in that order) by:
dpkg --install <package file>
In this process you may be asked to install some dependencies such as perl, perl-tk etc. from 
the regulr apt repositories. Please go ahead and do so if you intended to install the tools-package.
3. Optionally install the python based experimental tools using dpkg analogously to above
... you should now be able to run mxgui, mxrun and so on.


SOURCE-TARBALLS:
N.B. This requires cmake (version >2.8) to be installed on your target system
1. Unpack the kernel package. Change Directory to the unpacked tar-ball. Build and install the mcxtrace kernel using:
 cmake . && make && make install
2. Do tha same for the component tarball
3. Unpack the perl-tools tarball and mocve into it. Then do:
 cmake -Denable-mcxtrace=1 && make && make install
N.B. This assumes that you have permission to put files in the default installation directory e.g. /usr/local. If you do not you can either
install to a different location by replacing the command with e.g.
 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME . && make && make install
which will install to your users' HOME directory instead.
Alternatively (if you have root access), replace "make install" by "sudo make install"
