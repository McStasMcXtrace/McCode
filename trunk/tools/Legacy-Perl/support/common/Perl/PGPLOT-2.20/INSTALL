Installation
------------

Last update to this file: Apr 10th 2006

1) First you must compile and install the pgplot graphics libraries:

   The source can be obtained from the ftp site astro.caltech.edu
   in directory /pub/pgplot. Alternatively see the home ftp sites
   above. To build pgplot you need a FORTRAN compiler - the free
   compiler GNU-77 (or the newer GFORTRAN) works just fine. There
   is a PGPLOT Home Page at: http://astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/

2) Download and unpack the module. Then follow the standard Perl build
   procedure:

   perl Makefile.PL
   
   If you want to install somewhere other than the standard perl 
   location (e.g. in your home directory) replace this line with
   something like:
   
   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me
   
   make
   make test

   [When you run 'make test' you will be prompted for a graphics device.
    Try /XSERVE for a X11 display.]

   If something goes wrong read the file HELP, if everything works:

   make install
   
   If you want to install in the standard perl location you will need to 
   do this as root. (e.g. 'sudo make install')
   
   If you used PREFIX above the files will install themselves
   in /home/me/lib/perl5/site_perl/...
   
   Then to use them you will need to set the environment variable PERL5LIB 
   to point to this, e.g. for csh users:
   
   setenv PERL5LIB /home/me/lib/perl5/site_perl
