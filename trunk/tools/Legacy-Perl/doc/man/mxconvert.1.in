.TH mcconvert 1  "" "@MCCODE_STRING@" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
mcconvert \- Matlab/Scilab conversion tool of the McStas/McXtrace neutron ray-trace simulation package
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mcconvert [\-\-format=FORMAT][\-\-indir=IN][\-\-outdir=OUT] [file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mcconvert
command is the Matlab/Scilab conversion tool of the @MCCODE_NAME@ package. It converts Matlab files into Scilab equivalents, and vice-versa. As it works by replacing functions calls, it can handle data sets with binary files, as well as parameter scan data sets.
.PP
.B McStas
is a general tool for simulating neutron scattering instruments and experiments. It is actively supported by
.I Risoe National Laboratory
and
.I ILL
.B McXtrace
is the X-ray version of the package.

.PP
McStas is based on a compiler [mcstas(1)] that reads a high-level specification language defining the instrument to be simulated and produces C code that performs the Monte Carlo Simulation. The system is very fast in use, both when setting up the instrument definition and when doing calculations.
.PP
McStas supports all neutron scattering instruments, including triple-axis,  time-of-flight instruments, and polarised neutrons. It comes with a comprehensive manual and a library of well-tested components that include most standard elements of neutron scattering instruments, including steady-state and pulsed sources, monochromators/analysers, guides, collimators, vanadium and powder samples, velocity selectors and choppers, and a variety of detectors.
.PP
The package consists of the following user commands:
.TP
mcgui(1)
is the graphical user interface. Then use the
.I Neutron Site
menu to select an example instrument, and access the whole documentation for the
.I Help
menu. It contains an instrument editor, methods to plot simulation results, and much more
.TP
mcrun(1)
is the command-line tool for building and running simulations
.TP
mcplot(1)
is the simulation results plotting tool
.TP
mcdisplay(1)
is the instrument geometry and neutron trajectory viewer
.TP
mcdoc(1)
is the documentation tool
.TP
mcstas(1)
is the instrument compiler
.TP
.B mcconvert(1)
can convert Matlab data files into Scilab data files, and vice-versa. It also handles data sets with binary encoding. It also handles parameter scan results.
.TP
mcformat(1)
can transform any text data set from one format to an other. It does not support conversion from binary data sets. It can also merge equivalent results.
.PP
We encourage users to refer to the User and Component Manuals, which are available with the command
.B
mcdoc
