# ======================================== #

System Setup
------------

1) Check out the McCode SVN repos

2) Build all dependencies in trunk/BUILD_DEPS.TXT
     sudo apt-get (build-dep) install xbase-clients build-essential emacs subversion nginx-full python-django.
   Add openmpi and libopenmpi-dev if you need MPI. (Yes, you need it.)

3) Enable non-free repos:
      sudo apt-add-repository deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ wheezy main contrib non-free
      sudo wget packages.mccode.org/debian/mccode.list
   and run:
      sudo apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade

4) Add McCode repos and install mcstas-suite-perl or build the program fully to get McStas. Remember to run the 
   debs/rpms that are build by the compilation process as that is what installs McStas.
   Flag dpkg with -f to force the unmet deps to be installed too.


Setting up Django Webserver
---------------------------

5) Create the server dir and copy the server files into it, you are playing in the root dir now so you have to 
   sudo everything or run as root, change the permissions at the end if you don't like running round your 
   system as su:
     sudo mkdir /srv/mcstas-django
     sudo cp -rp /root/trunk/tools/Python/www/www-django/mcwww/ /srv/mcstas-django

6) Move to your shiny new working directory (the one you just made). Run:
     sudo bin/get-dependencies.sh

7) Populate sim/ with at least one instr - 
     sudo cp /usr/local/lib/mcstas-2.0/examples/PSI_DMC.instr sim

side note: Ensure your keyboard is set to a locale that the python scripts are happy with:
     export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"  

8) Run:
     sudo ./bin/init-db.sh

9) Follow the prompts, you should set up a superuser to start with, step 10a shows how to create new users:

   Username (leave blank to use 'root'): 
   E-mail address:
   Password: 
   Password (again): 
   Superuser created successfully.

10) Run the following commands (put the runworker in the background with '&' or open a new terminal):
   a)  sudo ./manage.py createuser <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>
   b)  sudo ./bin/update-simulations.sh ; ./manage.py populate_db
   c)  sudo ./manage.py runworker &
   d)  sudo ./manage.py runserver <IP ADDRESS>:<PORT> (80 is a good listening port)
