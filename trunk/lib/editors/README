20050206, code for setting up editors for McStas syntax highlighting

NEDIT:
nedit should be copied to a .nedit file in your home directory

KATE:
mcstas.xml is for usage with the excellent kate editor of KDE. Copy the 
file to e.g. /usr/share/apps/katepart/syntax/ (Correct path on a Debian 
testing system)
