Installation
============
To Install this library: (Scilab >= 2.7, the installation script
won't work even with 2.6)

We Suppose here that <PATH> stands for  the path of the directory
containing this README file.

- On Unix/Linux systems
     * Administrator
        Has to execute, once and for all, the following instruction
        within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>/builder.sce
        This operation requires permission to write in <PATH>/macros
        to generate *.bin, names and lib files in <PATH>/macros
        directory.
     * User
        Should execute the following instruction within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>/loader.sce
        before using the library. To prevent deletion of the library
	that would occur with the "clear" function, he can also put it
        in his .scilab startup file for automatic loading.

- On Windows systems
     * Administrator
        Has to execute, once and for all, the following instruction
        within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>\builder.sce
        This operation requires permission to write in <PATH>\macros
        to generate *.bin, names and lib files in <PATH>\macros
        directory.
    * User
        Should execute the following instruction within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>/loader.sce
        before using the library. To prevent deletion of the library
        that would occur with the "clear" function, he can also put it
        in his .scilab startup file for automatic loading.
