DONE/TODO/FUTURE list for next release of McStas (1.6)
Nov 27st, 2002 McStas 1.6.3k dev

Compiled by PW/EF from user wishes and different notes.

Tasks have been divided into 4 categories:

DONE   - reqd. task, done or very simple
TODO   - reqd. task, requires substantial work
FUTURE - needed, wanted, but postponed for later release
USER   - work for McStas user base more than developers

+ already implemented
- not yet implemented
? still to decide

*******************************************
DONE: 

Kernel:  OK

Runtime:
+ Ncount is 0/ncount when starting mcsiminfo_init()

Components:
+ Check Origin/Release line/add example: release/geography
+ change all monitors Nnum to double + Finally-> Save...
+ Prepare all for polarisation - done.
+ ESS moderators - done.
+ Monitor_nD, replace p by other phys. quantity, easy task.
+ Renaming of components (optics/samples) (e.g. Guide_*)
+ Monochromator, reflectivity curve from file. renormalisation by r0, simple.


Instruments:
- Intercomparison instruments H8, IRIS, RITA-II, IN12, TAS1, IN14,...
+ selftest ok

Tools: (GUI, plotting, running etc.)
- Automated optimization -> Optimisation (LM?) - great complexity... 
  Manual example?

Documentation:
- "Switch/Skip" components (Component group ABSORB GROUP COMPONENT - can be
  done,	example in manual?)
- "Share" components (done, sharing "shareable" parts - lib style)
- Logging event support (Can be done, Monitor_nd - example in manual?)
- "Split" neutrons (see switch/skip + extend feature - example in manual)
- Framework for table input ?!? (If about parameter input, should be
  doable, through defines)
- Compile runtime+shared functions - through example in manual.

*******************************************
TODO:

Kernel:

+ %include keyword for "inclusion" of components in components... (To
  think about), done. :) -> component_shares/My_function_name_include 
+ if no .c/.h, embed .h, and then .c if runtime, else display message
  for .o link  
- JUMP : goto comp label with current coords. May restore neutron before,
  depending on specific requirements. In cogen, define labels 'StartComp:' for 
  all comp instances. group will use that to go to next 
  labels: absorbAll, absorbComp
  EndComp is easier (in the same component, thus can go there to skip, 
    without knowing the name of the next one).
+ enable char parameters  : limited to 1024 char buffer. MC_CHAR_BUF_SIZE ?
+ SAVE section for intermediate savings
  
Runtime:
+ Gravity (functions defined, only used in gravity guide - merge
  propagation routines, easy task) g*,mcrotaComp
  Coords G=coords_set(0,-9.8,0);
  Coords localG=rot_apply(ROT_A_CURRENT_COMP, coords_set(0,-9.8,0));
+ save monitor data in different formats: 
    McStas ascii, NeXus XML, HTML, Scilab
    binary float, binary double
- Retrieve old monitor data, read from file by Virtual_input ->
  mcstas_r. not so easy -> NeXus -> runtime
  utility to identify which file is the right one ! read header for all, 
  look for comp instance name. Check file extension. Find field in header
+ rand_target_rect, modification according to formula.    
? move extend_list to external lib ? used in Powder_filter.comp, Filter_powder.comp, Single_crystal.comp, the Manual.
+ 3d data files saved linearly (2d), and rearranging as 3d after.
+ mcsave=simifo_init(NULL)/save/siminfo_close() (to get only latest save
    with right sim ratio)
+ binary export: ok (Virtual_input/output use that).
+ scilab export: rescale x,y,z to have cubic 2d plots
+ use extended output formats. Default should be mcstas+scilab. cc -D ALL_FORMATS ...
+ read_table-lib can read text files, binary files, starting at given offset, for a given number of lines
+ mcstas-r.c: handle binary file export ok, also for 'hidden/partial' files (not listed in .sim, as e.g. virtual sources = big files)
  

Components:
+ Monochromator_curved: add 'reflect/transmit' param info in header. 
  Add verbosity level and transmission efficiency if not scattered. Add spin ?
+ Monochromator_2foc: reflectivity ok
+ Monitor_nD: enable auto all, or auto for specified variables only.
    add FLAG_AUTO | COORD_TYPE
+ Monitor_nD plot banana and quadrant monitors (instead of whole circles)
  Intermediate saving trigger all saves
+ cylinder_intersect: return 0 no intersect, 1 on cylinder, 
  2/4/8/16 for in top/in bottom/out top/out bottom
+ Virtual_output - ok, macro for calling Monitor_nD? -
  Based on Vitess_output/Virtual_input
+ Virtual_input: use Table_Read, corrected repeat count/set_ncount  ok.
+ Sort components in categories, official, contrib, obsolete
+ verbose mode for complex components
+ Virtual_input crashes when filename does not exist. Pb with repeat nb. ok
+ Guide_gravity with general gravitation orientation ? set it at first neutron in ntrace
+ New Filter_gen, that may use any text data file
+ Virtual_input/output may read/write huge files, by fractions.
+ V_sample: may target to any component (compute target_x,y,z) given rel index
+ V_sample: may also be a box
- Res_monitor: as a cylinder/sphere monitor


- Check fluxes / absolute fluxes - provide experimental data +
  instrument definition 
- Powder component take input, written, should be tested.
  2 lines, n lines.
- Sample for SANS - existing components (single xtal ex.), other
  parms, powder to be checked.
- Bender, to be tested check for absolute fluxes, as compared to a
  number of linear guides.
- Filter_powder.comp, Single_crystal.comp : use Table_Read, extend_list  
- Source_Optimizer to be tested 
- Use Read_Table-lib for Single_crystal

- $Log: not supported by cvs2svn $ - cvs revision no, etc. for both McStas kernel / lib,
  automated using cvs?. Origin indicates research institution,
  McVersion required McStas Version

Instruments:
- Component test modules
- Moved to lib/examples/H8,... including instrument files + data +
  test results from "stable version" incl. test-script.

Tools: (GUI, plotting, running etc.)
- mcplot must rescale to 100 % simulation in case of visualisation of interrupted simulation. Only for intensity monitors.
+ mcplot can monitor single data file (not sim)
+ mcplot and mcdisplay can output gif
+ mcplot and mcdisplay can output ps/psc/gif and exit (non interactive)
+ mcplot does not work for scans: fixed. ok
+ mcgui: fixed a few minor problems
+ install now ok with sub dirs
+ mcstas2vitess ok for single components. Must use settings params only.
- Improve GUI - scilab.
- Status monitor support (Tool to be written - script) - access pid, daemon.
- html / png / page generation. (perhaps scilab based?) - mcplot?
- mcdisplay date checking for recompilation, through mcrun -n 1
- export in several formats, ps, gif (scilab), png (Imagemagick when available)
+ mcdisplay show help info when no arguments (l. 517)
- mcdoc: changed to show instruments also.
+ mcresplot works ok, even without 3D OpenGL/Mesa install

Documentation:
- FAQ list in manual
- Examples for group, share etc.
- Component manual info should be included, user auth. for contrib.
- valid latex2e code. (latex2html, pdftex etc.)
- doc directory.

Community related:
- Developers list mcstas-devel@risoe.dk
- License problems? Inclusion of GPL'ed mersene twister etc, png. etc.

*******************************************
FUTURE:

Kernel:
- Option to trace background events - no, perhaps absorbed neutrons
  instead?
- Loop/Additive groups - very complex, in principle can be done within each 
  component -> see JUMP
- MPI - pvm?
- Nexus - function calls (partially written)

Runtime:
- Functions for Nexus (to be written)
- additional data formats
    NeXus,  mcdirname gives internal NeXus path (including entry name), 
            file gives NeXus file name
    Vitess, (data is ascii, buffers is binary->Vitess_output)
    FITS  
      http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html
      http://archive.eso.org/saft/ (qfits)
    enable saving in code after checking existence of libraries or flags

Components:
- Inelastic samples, inclusion of already written components for this?
  Test reqd.
- Sample for amorphous materials, (inelastic?) structure from asympt. 
  apx. from powder sample.

Instruments:

Tools: (GUI, plotting, running etc.)
- Analyzer bank generator (RITA2 type setup), script
- mcdisplay 3D? ongoing...
- BatchMaker? Ask author to contibute
- improve Matlab and IDL export (binary, plot...)

Documentation:
