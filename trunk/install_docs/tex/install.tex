\maketitle
\abstract \noindent This document describes installation of the
\htmladdnormallink{McStas}{http://mcstas.risoe.dk} package, including
some information on installing other required pieces of software.\\\
\\The text below is also included as a chapter in the McStas manual.
\input{install_meat.tex}

Important note for Windows users: It is a known problem that some of
the \MCS\ tools do not support filenames / directories with spaces.
We are working on a more general approach to this problem, which will
hopefully be solved in the next release.
