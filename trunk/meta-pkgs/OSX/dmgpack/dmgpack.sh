#! /bin/bash

# dmgpack volume [file|dir]+
#
#    Copy a group of files/directories to a compressed disk image.
#    The resulting image is stored in volume.dmg.
#
#    Files are copied with 'ditto' to preserve resource forks.  For
#    convenience we also call FixupResourceForks after copying.  This
#    allows you to use /Developer/Tools/SplitFork on your tree and 
#    manipulate it with CVS, tar, etc.  Don't forget the -kb option 
#    when adding or committing app and ._app files to CVS!
#
#    This command will fail if a volume of the given name is already
#    mounted.  It could also fail if the size of the resource forks
#    is large compared to the size of the data forks. Change the
#    scale factor internally from 11/10 to a more appropriate number
#    if it complains it is running out of space.
#
#    It is possible to add a license agreement to a dmg file.  See
#    the "Software License Agreements for UDIFs" sdk available at
#    http://developer.apple.com/sdk/index.html
