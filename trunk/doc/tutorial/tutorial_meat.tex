\section{Basic neutron scattering}
You may recall the Bragg law from your high school physics
\[n\lambda=2d\sin(\theta),\]
giving the scattering condition for 
a wave of wavelength $\lambda$ against a series of
lattice planes with lattice spacing $d$, rotated the angle $\theta$
off the lattice plane normal. $n$ is an integer giving the spectral
order of the scattered wave. In neutron science one often refers to
the \emph{scattering vector}, $\vec{\kappa}$ of a given reflection, where
\[\kappa=|\vec{\kappa}|=n\frac{2\pi}{d}.\]
This gives us the scattering vector formulation of the Bragg law
\[\kappa=2k\sin(\theta),\]
where $k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$.
%such that
%\[n\lambda=4\pi \kappa^{-1}\sin(\theta)\]
The Bragg law / scattering condition is illustrated in Figure \ref{bragg.eps}.

\caption{Illustration of the Bragg Law.}

\end{figure}
Most of the neutron processes we will study in this paper are elastic,
meaning that the wavelength of the neutron is unaltered by the process.
\section{Basic understanding of instrument components}
In the McStas formulation of a neutron scattering instrument, all
objects apart from the neutron ray are referred to as components. This
includes for instance
\begin{itemize}
\item{{\bf Source} The exit of a neutron production facility, where
    neutron rays of certain velocities are emitted into some
    portion of space}
\item{{\bf Monochromator} (Idealized) crystal used to select a
    neutrons of a single wavelength $\lambda_0$ \footnote{In reality,
    the monochromator selects a normal distribution of wavelegths
    around $\lambda_0$, and perhaps higher orders as well ($n=2,3,...$
    in Braggs law)} to probe the sample with (monochromator) or to 
    analyze (analyzer)}
\item{{\bf Sample} An object altering the neutron physical properties
    in some sense, examples used here are}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{Vanadium. Scatters incoming neutron rays incoherently}
    \item{PowderN. Can be thought of as a large number of crystals,
        each scattering neutron rays according to the Bragg law, thereby
        producing N concentric Debye Scherrer cones. This sample also
        has the posibility of adding inchoherent, eleasticly scattered
        neutron rays.}
    \end{itemize}
\item{{\bf Monitors} Objects \emph{monitoring} or registering neutron ray
    characteristics. In the exercises below are used different types
    of detectors or monitors:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{Monitor. Single monitor, detecting the number of flying
        through a plane. (User defined opening size)}
    \item{PSD\_monitor. Square monitor, detecting the number of
        neutron rays passing through a plane, divided into
        pixels. Square regions of a plane. (User defined resolution 
        and opening size)}
    \item{PSD\_monitor\_4PI. As PSD\_monitor but shaped like a sphere.}
    \item{L\_monitor. Wavelength monitor, measuring the different
        wavelengths of the passing neutron rays. (L is for $\lambda$)}
    \item{Monitor\_nD. General monitor for detecting all sorts of
        physical properties of the neutron ray. In our cases used with
        options }
      \begin{itemize}
      \item{'single' - as PSD\_monitor but only one small square}
      \item{'banana' - as PSD\_monitor but shaped like a curved,
          horizontal band }
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item{{\bf Collimators}} Devices controling the direction and divergence
   of the neutron ray.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Collimator\_linear} A series of parallel absorbing neutron plates
       that limits the beam divergence. 
       Typical values are $6'$ to $120'$.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
More information on the McStas components is available by using the
\verb+mcdoc+ program (You may need to set the BROWSER system variable
to your webbrowser of choice):
\begin{itemize}
\item{\verb+mcdoc -s+ , Shows a html list of all the components}
\item{\verb+mcdoc Monitor.comp+ , Shows the documentation for a given component}
\item{\verb+mcdoc -M+ , brings up the McStas manual in PDF format}
\item{\verb+mcdoc -c+ , brings up the McStas component manual in PDF format}
\end{itemize}

\section{Basic McStas}
In short, the core of the McStas system is a precompiler. From a
user-provided instrument description, components are assembled into 
a single piece of \texttt{ansi-c} code. Using a compiler, e.g. 
\texttt{gcc}, the c code is compiled into an executable program 
which can be run on your computer. Optionally, the program takes 
input arguments to tune the setup of your instrument/simulation. 
This section will take you through a simple example instrument 
to teach you the basic instrument language of McStas. (Instrument 
filename is vanadium\_example.instr, can be loaded using the
\verb+Neutron Site/Tutorial+ menu item of the \verb+mcgui+, see below)

\end{verbatim}
Enlightened by the above example, you are probably now ready to learn
a few more important details and tips about McStas.
\begin{itemize}
\item{{\bf Neutron representation:} A neutron 'history' or package is
  an entity representing a large number of neutrons. It has the
  following physical properties:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{Spatial coordinates, $\vec{x}$ or $x,y,z$}
    \item{Velocity components, $\vec{v}$ or $v_x,v_y,v_z$}
    \item{Spin components, $\vec{s}$ or $s_x,s_y,s_z$}
    \item{Time, $t$}
    \item{Neutron weight factor, $p$}
  \end{itemize}
\item{{\bf Neutron histories/Intensities:} McStas simulates neutron
    histories rather than direct neutron counts, i.e. when a
    Monte Carlo choice is made in a given component (e.g. a random
    number is generated to decide a new direction of the neutron ray), 
    the neutron \emph{weight factor} is adjusted accordingly. As you
    may have guessed already, the weight factor is the 
    average number of of observed neutrons of a given behaviour.
    The transition to direct neutron intensites is made
    by adjusting the initial neutron weight of the source component,
    so that the sum of all simulated weight factors equals the
    absolute intensity of neutrons emitted in one
    second. This means that the intensity of the neutron beam at a
    given position is the initial neutron weight multiplied by the 
    product of all the Monte Carlo weight factors occuring from the
    source to the given position.  When observing McStas output, $I$
    is the intensity, not $N$.}
\item{{\bf 3D space:} The 3D space in which the instrument is defined,
  usually has a single component which is
  placed ABSOLUTEly  in space, e.g. at (0,0,0). All other components
  can be placed RELATIVE to this component.}
\item{{\bf Changing coordinate system:} Each component has its own
    local coordinate system. As the neutron travels from one component
    to the other, the local component coordinate system changes. The
    definition is that $z$ is the direction toward the next component,
    and that the $y$ direction is vertical. Our coordinate system is 
    right-handed, making $x$ horisontal and pointing left, looking in 
    the direction of $z$.}
\item{{\bf Component order matters!} It is important to understand
    that McStas is component order dependent. The basic idea is to
    follow the neutron as it travels from one component to the next in
    the instument description. This means that if you place one component
    \emph{geometrically} before another component, but \emph{orderly}
    after the other component, neutrons may never reach your 'first'
    component. This means that some designs can be difficult to
    achieve, though generally a solution can be found.}
\item{{\bf Use Arm()'s!} The Arm() component is very good for defining
  changed orientation of the instrument, e.g. for axis turning points
  etc. Placing many Arm()'s will improve future flexibility of your
  instrument.}
\item{{\bf Use PSD\_monitor()'s!} The PSD\_monitor() component is a
    {\bf p}osition {\bf s}ensitive {\bf d}etector. This component can
    be used to image the shape of your beam as it travels through the
    instrument. This is very useful for debugging purposes. Other
    monitors, for instance wavelength monitors can also be useful.}}

\section{Exercises}
Throughout the rest of this paper, you will have to do the work!
Through a series of small exercises, you will set up and use two simple
neutron scattering instruments: a two axis diffractometer and a triple axis spectrometer. To get an idea of what your final
instrument might look like, see the sample instrument protrayed in Figure \ref{instr.eps}.
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{pics/instr.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Illustration of a triple axis diffractometer}
\label{instr.eps}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Exercise: Source and PSD}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Start by inserting a template instrument (Insert menu). Set up an instrument, consisting only of an Arm (keep the example 'a1' Arm instance), a Source\_Maxwell\_3,
a PSD\_monitor and an L\_monitor. Read the documentation for each of
the components to find the needed input parameters. For the source we
will help you out, try
\begin{verbatim}
COMPONENT source = Source_Maxwell_3(
    size = 0.1, l_low = 0.1, l_high = 10, dist = 10, xw = 0.01,
    yh = 0.01, T1 = 300, T2=300, T3=300, I1=1e14, I2=0, I3=0)
\end{verbatim}
Read the Source\_Maxwell\_3 docs using mcdoc to understand the
suggested parameters. The file names for monitors, specified as character strings, should be given \emph{surrounded} by double quotes ("file.dat").}
\item{Run a simulation and plot the results, looking
at an image of the source plus the wavelength distribution of the
source. }
\item{Narrow down the interval of wavelengths emitted from the
source to e.g. l\_low=0.999 and l\_high=1.001. Rerun your simulation to
check the effect. Reset the wavelength interval to [0.1 10] \AA.}
\item{Estimate the solid angle covered by your PSD. Try if you can
  understand I, the neutron intensity in the PSD, in the two previous
  runs. Try running the simulation with half or double the number of
  neutron rays. Try also to vary the source focus area. Explain what you observe.}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Exercise: Insert a monochromator}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Keeping your current components, insert a Monochromator\_flat
component (use mcdoc or the component manual to get the needed parameters) and a
new set of PSD and L\_monitor after the monochromator. You should now add
two new input parameters of your instrument, e.g. OMM (Omega
Monochromator) and TTM (Two Theta Monochromator)
for rotation of the monochromator and the remaining part of the 
instrument so that the orientation of
monochromator is as portrayed in Figure \ref{mono.eps}.
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{pics/mono.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Illustration of the monochromator orientation}
\label{mono.eps}
\end{figure}
These two instrument input parameters should be added to the DEFINE line of the instrument (start of file). Remember to add an Arm() at the rotation point. }
\item{Given $\lambda$ = 4\AA, and knowing that for the
monochromator $\kappa=1.8734$ \AA$^{-1}$ (Pyrolytic Graphite), use Bragg's law to determine the 
correct Bragg angle (i.e. OMM/TTM) for the monochromator for the $n=1$ reflection. }
\item{Do a scan of OMM a couple of angles around this value to verify
    the finding, keeping TTM fixed. This will be achieved by setting the OMM value to 'min,max' (replace by relevant numerical values) in the Run Simulation window, and selecting the Scan check button in that same window. Enter the number of steps to compute (e.g. 10). Check the position of the peak on
    the PSD and the wavelength on the L\_monitor. }
\item{What should $\kappa$ be set to to get the $n=2$ reflection at exactly
    OMM=45$^\circ$ (TTM=90$^\circ$)?
Adjust $\kappa$ for the monochromator and verify the calculation by a
scan, check the wavelength. }
\item{Determine the Bragg angle for the $n=1$ reflection in this
setting of $\kappa$, and verify by scaning OMM. Set OMM to this
value. Perform the simulation and check the wavelength distribution.
Comment.}
\item{Before you go on, change the minimum and maximum wavelengths of
    the source to a suitably narrow interval around the wavelength you select,
    e.g. 4\AA. (No need to
    produce neutron rays that will not be scattered at the monochromator...)}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Exercise: Insert a sample}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Now, insert a \verb+V_sample()+ component (Vanadium scatters
    incoherently, i.e. in all
    directions) after the last PSD\_monitor and L\_monitor. Insert a Beamstop component after the sample, e.g. AT
    (0,0,0.5) RELATIVE sample. 
    At the
    same position as the sample, insert a PSD\_monitor\_4PI\_log component of radius
    1.0 m., located AT (0,0,0) RELATIVE to your sample.
    Read the documentation for details on input parameters.
    Run a simulation. Notice the number of hits.}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Exercise: Insert a different sample}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Next, let us insert something more interesting. Remove the
    V\_sample and  PSD\_monitor\_4PI\_log. Insert a PowderN component
    with the following parameters:
    \begin{verbatim}
COMPONENT sample = PowderN(radius=0.01,h=0.01, d_phi0=0.1, pack=0.5, 
   DW=0.9, frac=0.5, focus_r=0.03, reflections="mylist.dat",
   Vc=3.86*3.86*11.82, sigma_abs=0, sigma_inc=2, barns=1)
  AT (0, 0, 0) RELATIVE a4
\end{verbatim}
You should also create a list of reflections, e.g. \texttt{mylist.dat}
with the following contents:
\begin{verbatim}
# column_j 3 multiplicity 'j'
# column_q 1  Scattering vector modulus [Angs^-1]
# column_F2 2 Scattering factor |F^2| in [barns]
1 1000 8
1.3 1000 4
\end{verbatim}

(Adjust placement relative to your component naming etc.). Also insert
  a banana shaped detector,
\begin{verbatim}
COMPONENT ND = Monitor_nD(xwidth=1, options="banana, theta limits=[-45 45],auto y")
  AT (0,0,0) RELATIVE a5
\end{verbatim}
and take away the previously inserted Beamstop. Test that neutrons
reach the detector, then run a long simulation (many neutron rays) and have coffee.}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Exercise: Insert an analyzer}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Insert a single detector by changing the options for the
    Monitor\_nD component to ``single''. Also, add an angle to rotate
    the part of the instrument located after the sample, e.g. TT (Two
    $\Theta$) and decide a more relevant size of the now rectangular detector. Look at your results from the last simulation to
    determine an approximate scan range for the TT angle. Also,
    set a small focus\_r on the sample component to minimize
    calculation time on non-detected neutron rays. Scan TT across the
    powder lines.}
\item{Between sample and detector, set up an analyser crystal by
    copying and modifying your monochromator component. (Add new arms
    and angles OMA, TTA - A is for Analyzer - for adjusment.) 
    Adjust the analyser to Bragg condition
    for the chosen wavelength. Re-scan TT and notice the difference to
    the scan performed in the previous task. Try also scanning around
    -TT and notice the difference to the other scan. Can you explain
    the difference?}
\end{enumerate}
