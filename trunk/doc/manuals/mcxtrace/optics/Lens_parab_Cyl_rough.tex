\section{Lens\_parab\_Cyl\_rough: Thick 1D-parabolic CRL including roughness-model}
\index{Optics!lens}
\mcdoccomp{optics/Lens_parab_Cyl_rough.parms}

Identical to \textbf{Lens\_parab\_Cyl} except it has the option of a \textit{roughness} parameter.
Roughness is simply modelled by a stochatstic, normally distributed, displacement of the normal vector of the lens surfaces.

This component and its functionality is scheduled to be merged into \texttt{Lens\_parab}
