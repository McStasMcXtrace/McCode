\section{Filter: A general absorption filter model}
\label{s:filter}
\index{Optics!Filter}
\mcdoccomp{optics/Filter.parms}

This component is a filter in the shape of a rectangular block or a general
shape defined by a set of polygons. Given an input file containing material
parameters. Neccessary parameters are nominal density and a parameterization of
the linear attenuation coefficient, $\mu$ as a function of wavelength (or
energy).

The model is very simple: Firstly the X-ray is traced to find intersection points between ray and filter (0 or 2).
If no intersection is found the x-ray is left untouched and nothing further happens.
Assuming the ray intersects the filter: Secondly, the path length d$l$ within the filter is computed.
Thirdly a $\mu = f(\lambda,\mathrm{material})$ is computed by interpolating in
a datafile, and the x-ray weight is adjusted according to
$p=p\exp(-\mathrm{d}l*\mu)$. The x-ray is left at the point where it exits the
filter block (the $2$nd intersection).

Example data files corresponding to all elements up to $Z=92$ are distributed with \MCX in the
\verb+MCXTRACE/data+ directory as \verb+*.txt+ files. These tables have been
extracted from the NIST FFAST~\cite{NIST-ffast} x-ray database.
To generate other datafiles from the same source a simple shell script:
\verb+MCXTRACE/data/get_xray_db_data+ is also distributed with \MCX
Running this script will connect to the NIST webiste and download a
\verb+.html+ file. This output must now be modified such that \verb+html+-tags
are removed and all header lines begin with $\#$

\subsection{Example}
\label{getNISTdata}
This is an example of how to download and generate datafiles for the \verb+Filter.comp+ and others.

The distributed tables have been extracted from the NIST x-ray database. To ease generation of more dtafiles
from the same source a simple shell script:\\
\verb+MCXTRACE/data/get_xray_db_data+\\
is also distributed with \MCX

Running this script will connect to the NIST webiste and download a \verb+.html+ file. This output must now be modified wuch that \verb+html+-tags
are removed and all header lines begin with $\#$.

\begin {verbatim}
 /usr/local/lib/mcxtrace/data/get_xray_db_data 3 output.dat
\end{verbatim}
where the second parameter (3) is the atom number of the material, for which we want to generate a datafile.
Now open the generated datafile (\verb+output.dat+) with your favourite text editor and make sure the file ends up looking like this

Please make sure you don't forget to remove the html-tags in the bottom of the file as well. In the future we will set
up a more streamlined way of doing this.
