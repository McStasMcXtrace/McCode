\section{Lens\_parab: Thick parabolic CRL}
\index{Optics!lens}
\mcdoccomp{optics/Lens_parab.parms}

Component model of a stack of compund refractive lenses. Each lens in the stack is modelled by two parabolic surfaces, and rays are traced through all the complete stack  taking the displace,ement of the surfaces into account. This is naturally less efficient than a thin lens approximation.

The functionality of \texttt{Lens\_parab\_Cyl}, \texttt{Lens\_parab\_rough}, and \texttt{Lens\_parab\_Cyl\_rough} will be merged into this component.
