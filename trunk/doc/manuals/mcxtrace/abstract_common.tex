The software package McXtrace is a tool for carrying out Monte Carlo
ray-tracing simulations of xray scattering beamlines with high
complexity and precision. The simulations can compute all aspects of the
performance of instruments and can thus be used to optimize the use of
existing equipment, design new instrumentation, and carry out virtual
experiments for e.g. training, experimental planning or data analysis. 
McXtrace is based is based on a unique design, inhereted from its sister McStas, 
where an automatic compilation process
translates high-level textual instrument descriptions into efficient
ANSI-C code. This design makes it simple to set up typical simulations
and also gives essentially unlimited freedom to handle more unusual
cases.
