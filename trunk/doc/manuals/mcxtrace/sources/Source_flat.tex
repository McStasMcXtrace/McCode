\section{Source\_flat: A flat surface emitting photons with a spectrum either uniform, gaussian or generated from a datafile}

A simple source model, with a flat surface emitting photons. The surface in the
$xy$-plane is specified as a rectangle with dimensions
$x_{width}\times y_{height}$ m, or as a circle w radius,$r$. 
The initial xray position is chosen randomly in the source surface --- its
wavevector is chosen randomly (exactly as in the case of \textbf{Source\_pt}
(section \ref{source-pt}) in the defining aperture with height $h$ and
width $w$ placed at $(0,0,dist)$. 

Just as for \textbf{Source\_pt} the aperture is for efficiency purposes and, if misused, may cause biasing.

With the exception of source size related parameters, all other parameters are identical to \textbf{Source\_pt} 
Not that this also applies to coherence and photon phase. If \textit{randomphase}$=0$ then a photon emitted from $(x_0,y_0,0)$ will in phase with a photon
emitted from $(x_1,y_1,0)$. I.e. full transversal coherence.
