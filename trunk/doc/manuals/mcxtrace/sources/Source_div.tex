\textbf{Source\_div} is a rectangular source, $w \times h$, which emits a
beam of a specified divergence around the direction of the $z$ axis.
The beam intensity is uniform over
the whole of the source, and the energy (or wavelength) distribution
of the beam is uniform over the specified energy range
$E_0 \pm \Delta E$ (in meV), or alternatively
the wavelength range $\lambda_0 \pm \delta\lambda$ (in \AA ).

The source divergences are $\delta_h$ and $\delta_v$ (FWHM in degrees).
If the \verb+gauss+ flag is set to 0 (default),
the divergence distribution is uniform, otherwise it is Gaussian.

This component may be used as a simple model of the
beam profile at the end of a guide or at the sample position.
