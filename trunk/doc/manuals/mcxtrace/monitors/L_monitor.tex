\section{L\_monitor: The wavelength sensitive monitor}
\label{s:L_monitor}
\index{Monitors!Wavelength monitor}
\mcdoccomp{monitors/L_monitor.parms}

The component \textbf{L\_monitor} is very similar to
\textbf{E\_monitor}.
This component is just sensitive to the xray wavelength.
The wavelength spectrum is output in a one-dimensional histogram.
between $\lambda_\mathrm{min}$ and $\lambda_\mathrm{max}$ (measured in \AA ).

As for the two other 1-dimensional monitors, this component outputs
the total counts and a file with the histogram.
