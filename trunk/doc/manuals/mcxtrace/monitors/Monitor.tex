The \textbf{Monitor} component is a simple photon counter that merely detects the integrated
intensity in an aperture \textit{xwidth} by \textit{yheight} \si{m^2}. It does \emph{not} write 
a separate datafile, but reports the $I, I_err, N$-signals to the console. The signals represent
 intensity, error estimate, and number of statistical events (photon rays).
