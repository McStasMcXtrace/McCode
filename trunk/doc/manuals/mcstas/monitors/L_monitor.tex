The component {\bf L\_monitor} is very similar to
{\bf TOF\_monitor} and {\bf E\_monitor}.
This component is just sensitive to the neutron wavelength.
The wavelength spectrum is output in a one-dimensional histogram.
between $\lambda_{\rm min}$ and $\lambda_{\rm max}$ (measured in \AA ).

As for the two other 1-dimensional monitors, this component outputs
the total counts and a file with the histogram.
