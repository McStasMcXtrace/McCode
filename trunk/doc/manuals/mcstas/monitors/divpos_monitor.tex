{\bf DivPos\_monitor} is a two-dimensional monitor component,
which is sensitive to both horizontal position ($x$) and horizontal divergence
defined by $\eta_{\rm h} = \tan^{-1}(v_x/v_z)$.
The detector window is set
by the $x$ and $y$ input coordinates.

The neutron counts are being histogrammed
into $n_x \times n_{\rm h}$ pixels. The horizontal divergence range accepted is
$[-\eta_{\rm h,max}; \eta_{\rm h,max}]$, and the horizontal position
range is the size of the detector.

The output from {\bf PSD\_monitor} is the integrated counts, $n, I, M_2$,
as well as
three two-dimensional arrays of counts: $n(x,\eta_{\rm h}),
I(x,\eta_{\rm h}), M_2(x,\eta_{\rm h})$.
The arrays are written to a file and can be read e.g. by the tool
{\bf mcplot}, see the system manual.

This component can be used for measuring acceptance diagrams \cite{Cussen03}.
{\bf PSD\_monitor} can easily be changed into being sensitive
to $y$ and vertical divergence by a 90 degree rotation around the $z$-axis.
