\section{PSD\_monitor: The PSD monitor}
\index{Monitors!Position sensitive detector (PSD)}
\component{PSD\_monitor}{System}{$x_{\rm min}$, $x_{\rm max}$, $y_{\rm min}$, $y_{\rm max}$, $n_x$, $n_y$, filename}{}{}


The component {\bf PSD\_monitor} resembles other monitors, e.g.
{\bf TOF\_Monitor}, and also propagates the neutron ray to the detector
surface in the $(x,y)$-plane, where the detector window is set
by the $x$ and $y$ input coordinates.
The PSD monitor, though, is not sensitive to the arrival time
of the neutron ray, but rather to its position.
The rectangular monitor window, given by the $x$ and $y$
limits is divided into $n_x \times n_y$ pixels.

The output from {\bf PSD\_monitor} is the integrated counts, $n, I, M_2$,
as well as
three two-dimensional arrays of counts: $n(x,y), I(x,y), M_2(x,y)$.
The arrays are written to a file, \verb+filename+, and can be read e.g. by the tool
{\bf mcplot}, see the system manual.
