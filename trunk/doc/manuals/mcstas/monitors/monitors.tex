In real neutron experiments, detectors and monitors play quite
different roles. One wants the detectors to be as efficient as
possible, counting all neutrons (absorbing them in the process),
while the monitors measure the intensity of the incoming beam, and must
as such be almost transparent, interacting only with (roughly) 0.1-1\%
of the neutrons passing by. In computer simulations, it is
of course possible to detect every neutron ray without
absorbing it or disturbing any of its parameters. Hence, the two components
have very similar functions in the simulations, and we do
not distinguish between them. For simplicity, they are from here on
just called {\bf monitors}.

Another important difference between computer simulations
and real experiments is
that one may allow the monitor to be sensitive to any neutron property,
as {\em e.g.} direction, energy, and divergence, in addition to what
is found in real-world detectors (space and time). One may, in
fact, let the monitor record correlations between these properties,
as seen for example in the divergence/position sensitive monitor in
section~\ref{s:divpos-monitor}.

When a monitor detects a neutron ray,
a number counting variable is incremented: $n_i = n_{i-1}+1$.
In addition, the neutron
weight $p_i$ is added to the weight counting variable:
$I_i = I_{i-1} + p_i$,
and the second moment of the weight is
updated: $M_{2,i} = M_{2,i-1} + p_i^2$.
As also discussed chapter \ref{s:MCtechniques}, after a simulation of $N$ rays
the detected intensity (in units of neutrons/sec.) is $I_N$,
while the estimated errorbar is $\sqrt{M_{2,N}^2}$.

Many different monitor components have been developed for
\MCS , but we have decided to support only the most important ones.
One example of the monitors we have omitted is the single monitor,
{\bf Monitor},
that measures just one number (with errorbars) per simulation.
This effect is mirrored by any of the 1- or 2-dimensional components
we support, e.g. the {\rm PSD\_monitor}.
In case additional functionality of monitors is required,
the few code lines of existing monitors can easily be modified.

However, the ultimate solution is the use of the
``Swiss army knife'' of monitors, {\bf Monitor\_nD}, that can face
almost any simulation requirement,
but will prove challenging for users who like to perform own modifications.
