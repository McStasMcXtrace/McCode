This component is an ideal flat filter
that changes the neutron flux according to a 1D input table (text file).

{\bf Filter\_gen} may act as a source ($options$="set")
or a filter ($options$="multiply", default mode).
The table itself is a 2 column free format file which accept comment lines.
The first table column represents wavevector, energy, or wavelength,
as specified in the $options$ parameter,
whereas the second column is the transmission/weight modifier.

A usage example as a source would use
\verb+options="wavelength, set"+, if the first column in the data
is supposted to be $\lambda$ (in \AA ).
Another example using the component as a filter would be
\verb+options="energy, multiply"+ if the first column is $E$ (in meV).

The input parameters are the filter window size
$x_{min}$, $x_{max}$, $y_{min}$, $y_{max}$,
the behaviour specification string $options$ and the file to use $file$.
Additionally, rescaling can be made automatic with the $scaling$
and relative $thickness$ parameters. If for instance the transmission data file
corresponds to a 5 cm thick filter, and one would like to simulate a 10 cm thick filter,
then use $thickness = 2$.

Some example data files are given with \MCS in the
\verb+MCSTAS/data+ directory as \verb+*.trm+ files for transmission.

The filter geometry is a flat plane. A geometry with finite thickness can be simulated by
surrounding this component with two slits.
