This component simulates an infinitely thin single
crystal with a single scattering vector, $Q_0=2\pi / d_m$, perpendicular to the
surface. A typical
use for this component is to simulate a simple monochromator or analyzer.

The monochromator dimensions are given by the length, $z_{\rm w}$, and
the height, $y_{\rm h}$. As the parameter names indicate, the
monochromator is placed in the $z-y$ plane of the local coordinate system.
This definition is made to ensure that the physical monochromator angle
(often denoted \verb+A1+) will equal the \MCS rotation angle
of the Monochromator component around the $y$-axis.
$R_0$ is the maximal reflectivity and
$\eta_{\rm h}$ and $\eta_{\rm v}$ are the horizontal and vertical mosaicities,
respectively, see explanation below.

\subsection{Monochromator physics and algorithm}
The physical model used in {\bf Monochromator\_flat} is a rectangular piece of
material composed of a large number of small micro-crystals.
The orientation of the
micro-crystals deviates from the nominal crystal orientation so that the
probability of a given micro-crystal orientation is proportional to a
Gaussian in the angle between the given and the nominal orientation. The
width of the Gaussian is given by the mosaic spread, $\eta$, of the crystal
(given in units of arc minutes).
$\eta$ is assumed to be large compared to the inherent Bragg width of the
scattering vector (often a few arc seconds).
(The mosaicity gives rise to a Gaussian reflectivity profile of width
similar to - but not equal - the intrinsic mosaicity.
In this component, and in real life, the mosaicity given is that of the
reflectivity signal.)

As a further simplification, the crystal is assumed to be infinitely
thin. This means that multiple scattering effects are not simulated. It
also means that the total reflectivity, $r_0$ is used as a parameter for
the model rather than the atomic scattering cross section, implying that
the scattering efficiency does not vary with neutron wavelength.
The variance
of the lattice spacing ($\Delta d/d$) is assumed to be zero, so this
component is not suitable for simulating backscattering instruments (use
the component {\rm Single\_crystal}
in section~\ref{s:Single_crystal} for that).

When a neutron trajectory intersects the crystal, the first step in the
computation is to determine the probability of scattering. This
probability is then used in a Monte Carlo choice deciding whether to
scatter or transmit the neutron. The physical scattering probability is the sum
of the probabilities of first- second-, and higher-order scattering -
up to the highest order possible for the given neutron wavelength.
However, in most cases at most one order will have a
significant scattering probability, and the computation thus considers
only the order that best matches the neutron wavelength.

The scattering of neutrons from a crystal is governed by Bragg's law:
\begin{equation}
n{\bf Q}_0 = 2{\bf k}_i\sin\theta
\end{equation}
The scattering order is specified by the integer $n$. We seek only one
value of $n$, namely the one which makes
$n {\bf Q}_0$ closest to the projection of $2{\bf k}_i$ onto ${\bf Q}_0$
(see figure~\ref{f:mosaic_order}).
%  k=2PI/lambda
%  q=2k sin(theta)
%
%  2 PI n/k = d q/2k
%  q = n 4 PI/d
%
%  n 2PI/k = n 4 PI/q \sin\theta
%  1/k = 2/q\sin\theta
%  n q = 2k\sin\theta

Once $n$ has been determined, the Bragg angle $\theta$ can be
computed. The angle $\alpha$ is the amount one would need to
turn the nominal scattering vector ${\bf Q}_0$ for the monochromator
to be in Bragg scattering condition.
We now use $\alpha$ to compute the probability of reflection from
the mosaic crystal
\begin{equation}
p_{\rm reflect} = R_0 e^{-\alpha^2/2\eta^2},
\end{equation}
The probability $p_{\rm reflect}$ is used
in a Monte Carlo choice to decide whether the neutron is transmitted or
reflected.

In the case of reflection, the neutron will be scattered into the
Debye-Scherrer cone, with the probability of each point on the cone
being determined by the mosaic. The Debye-Scherrer cone can be described
by the equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mosaic_cone}
  {\bf k}_{\rm f} = {\bf k}_{\rm i}\cos2\theta +
      \sin2\theta({\bf c}\cos\varphi + {\bf b}\sin\varphi),
      \qquad\varphi\in[-\pi;\pi],
\end{equation}
where ${\bf b}$ is a vector perpendicular to ${\bf k}_{\rm i}$ and ${\bf
Q}_0$, ${\bf c}$ is perpendicular to ${\bf k}_{\rm i}$ and ${\bf b}$,
and both ${\bf b}$ and ${\bf c}$ have the same length as ${\bf k}_{\rm i}$
(see figure~\ref{f:mosaic_cone}). When choosing $\varphi$ (and
thereby ${\bf k}_{\rm f}$), only a small part of the full $[-\pi; \pi]$
range will have appreciable scattering probability in non-backscattering
configurations. The best statistics is thus obtained by sampling
$\varphi$ only from a suitably narrow range.

The (small) deviation angle $\alpha$ of the nominal
scattering vector $n{\bf Q}_0$ corresponds to a $\Delta q$ of
\begin{equation}
\Delta q \approx \alpha 2k\sin\theta.
\end{equation}
The angle $\varphi$ corresponds to a $\Delta k_{\rm f}$ (and hence
$\Delta q$) of
\begin{equation}
\Delta q \approx \varphi k \sin(2\theta)
\end{equation}
(see figure~\ref{f:mosaic_cone}).
Hence we may sample $\varphi$ from a Gaussian with standard deviation
\begin{equation}
\alpha\frac{2k\sin\theta}{k\sin(2\theta)} =
\alpha\frac{2k\sin\theta}{2k\sin\theta\cos\theta} =
\frac{\alpha}{\cos\theta}
\end{equation}
to get good statistics.

What remains is to determine the neutron weight. The distribution from
which the scattering event is sampled is a Gaussian in $\varphi$ of
width $\frac{\alpha}{\cos\theta}$,
\begin{equation}
    f_{\rm MC}(\varphi) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}(\sigma/\cos\theta)}
            e^{-\varphi^2/2(\sigma/\cos\theta)^2}
\end{equation}
In the physical model, the probability of the scattering event is
proportional to a Gaussian in the angle between the nominal scattering
vector ${\bf Q}_0$ and the actual scattering vector ${\bf q}$. The
normalization condition is that the integral over all $\varphi$ should
be 1. Thus the probability of the scattering event in the physical model
is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mosaic_integral}
  \Pi(\varphi) = e^{\frac{-d(\varphi)^2}{2\sigma^2}} /
   \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{\frac{-d(\varphi)^2}{2\sigma^2}} d\varphi
\end{equation}
where $d(\varphi)$ denotes the angle between the nominal scattering
vector and the actual scattering vector corresponding to $\varphi$.
According to equation~(\ref{probrule}), the weight adjustment $\pi_j$ is
then given by
\begin{equation}
\pi_j = \Pi(\varphi) / f_{\rm MC}(\varphi).
\end{equation}
In the implementation, the integral in~(\ref{eq:mosaic_integral}) is computed
using a 15-order Gaussian quadrature formula, with the integral
restricted to an interval of width $5\sigma/\cos\theta$ for the same
reasons discussed above on the sampling of $\varphi$.
