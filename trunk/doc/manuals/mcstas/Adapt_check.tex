\component{Adapt\_check}{K. Nielsen}{source\_comp}{}{validated}

The component {\bf Adapt\_check} is used together with the Source\_adapt component - see section \ref{s:Source_adapt} for details. When placed somewhere in an instrument using Source\_adapt as a source, the source will optimize for neutrons that reach that point without being absorbed (regardless of neutron position, divergence, wavelength, \emph{etc}).

The Adapt\_check component takes as single input parameter \emph{source\_comp} the name of the Source\_adapt component instance, for example:

\begin{lstlisting}
...
COMPONENT mysource = Source_adapt(...)
...
COMPONENT mycheck = Adapt_check(source_comp = mysource)
...
\end{lstlisting}

Only one instance of Adapt\_check is allowed in an instrument.

We suggest, as alternative method, to make use of the \texttt{SPLIT} keyword, as described in the \MCS\ User Manual.
