\chapter{Source components}
\label{c:source}
\index{Sources|textbf}
\index{Library!Components!sources}

\MCS\ contains a number of different source components,
and any simulation will usually contain exactly one of these sources.
The main function of a source is to determine a set of initial
parameters $({\bf r}, {\bf v}, t)$
for each neutron ray. This is done by Monte Carlo choices from
suitable distributions. For example, in most present sources
the initial position is
found from a uniform distribution over the source surface,
which can be chosen to be either circular or rectangular.
The initial neutron velocity is selected within an interval
of either the corresponding energy or the corresponding wavelength.
Polarization is not relevant for sources,
and we initialize the neutron average spin to zero: ${\bf s}=(0,0,0)$.

For time-of-flight sources, the choice of the emission time, $t$,
is being made on basis of detailed analytical expressions.
For other sources, $t$ is set to zero.
In the case one would like to use a steady state source
with time-of-flight settings,
the emission time of each neutron ray should be determined using
a Monte Carlo choice. This may be achieved by
the \verb+EXTEND+ keyword in the instrument description source
as in the example below:\index{Keyword!EXTEND}

\begin{verbatim}
  TRACE

  COMPONENT MySource=Source_gen(...) AT (...)
  EXTEND
  %{
    t = 1e-3*randpm1(); /* set time to +/- 1 ms */
  %}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Neutron flux}
\label{s:neutron-flux}
The flux of the sources deserves special attention. The total neutron
intensity is defined as the sum of weights of all emitted neutron rays
during one simulation
(the unit of total neutron weight is thus neutrons per second).
The flux, $\psi$, at an instrument is defined as intensity per area perpendicular
to the beam direction.

The source flux, $\Phi$, is defined in different units:
the number of neutrons emitted per second from a
1~cm$^2$ area on the source surface,
with direction within a 1~ster.\ solid angle,
and with wavelength within a 1 {\AA} interval.
The total intensity of real neutrons emitted towards a given diaphragm
(units: n/sec) is therefore (for constant $\Phi$):
\begin{equation}
I_{\rm total} = \Phi A \Delta\Omega \Delta\lambda ,
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the source area, $\Delta\Omega$ is the solid angle of the
diaphragm as seen from the source surface, and $\Delta\lambda$ is the
width of the wavelength interval in which neutrons are emitted (assuming
a uniform wavelength spectrum).

The simulations are performed so that detector intensities
are independent of the number of neutron histories simulated
(although more neutron histories will give better statistics).
If $N_{\rm sim}$ denotes the number of
neutron histories to simulate, the initial neutron weight $p_0$ must be set to
\begin{equation}
\label{proprule}
p_0 = \frac{N_{\rm total}}{N_{\rm sim}} =
    \frac{\Phi(\lambda)}{N_{\rm sim}} A \Omega \Delta\lambda ,
\end{equation}
where the source flux is now given a $\lambda$-dependence.

As a start, we recommend new \MCS\ users to use the
{\bf Source\_simple} component.
Slightly more realistic sources are {\bf Source\_Maxwell\_3} for
continuous sources or {\bf Moderator} for time-of-flight sources.

Optimizers can dramatically improve the statistics, but may occasionally
give wrong results, due to misleaded optimization.
You should always check such simulations with (shorter) non-optimized ones.

Other ways to speed-up simulations are to read events from a file.
See section \ref{sources-seealso} for details.

\section{Other sources components: contributed pulsed sources, virtual sources (event files)}
\label{sources-seealso}

There are many other source definitions in \MCS .

Detailed pulsed source components are available for new facilities
in a number of contributed components:
\begin{itemize}
\item SNS ({\bf contrib/SNS\_source}),
\item ISIS ({\bf contrib/ISIS\_moderator}) see section \ref{isis-moderator},
\item ESS-project ({\bf ESS\_moderator\_long} and {\bf  ESS\_moderator\_short}).
\end{itemize}

When no analytical model (e.g. a Maxwellian distribution) exits,
one may have access to measurements, estimated flux distributions,
event files, and - better - to MCNP/Triploli4 neutron event records.
The following components are then useful:

\begin{itemize}
\item{{\bf misc/Virtual\_input} can read a \MCS\ event file
(in text or binary format), often bringing an order-of-magnitude speed-up.
See section \ref{virtual_input}.}
\item{{\bf contrib/Virtual\_tripoli4\_input} does the same, but from event files (text format) obtained from the \emph{Tripoli4} \cite{tripoli_webpage} reactor simulation program. Such files are usually huge.\index{Tripoli}}
\item{{\bf contrib/Virtual\_mcnp\_input} can read MCNP "PTRAC" event files (text format) obtained from the \emph{MCNP} \cite{mcnp_webpage} reactor simulation program. Such files are usually huge.\index{MCNP}}
\item{{\bf misc/Vitess\_input} can read \emph{Vitess} \cite{vitess_webpage} neutron event binary files.\index{Vitess}}
\item{{\bf optics/Filter\_gen} reads a 1D distribution from a file, and may either modify or set the flux according to it. See section \ref{filter-gen}.}
\end{itemize}
