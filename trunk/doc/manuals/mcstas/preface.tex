\chapter*{Preface and acknowledgments}
This document contains information on the Monte Carlo neutron
ray-tracing program \MCS version \version, building on the initial
release in October 1998 of version 1.0 as presented in
Ref. ~\cite{nn_10_20} and further developed though version 2.0 as
presented in Ref. ~\cite{mcs_ppf}.
The reader of this document is supposed to have some knowledge of neutron scattering,
whereas only little knowledge about simulation techniques is
required. In a few places, we also assume familiarity with the
use of the C programming language and UNIX/Linux.

If you don't want to read this manual in full, go directly to the brief introduction in chapter \ref{s:brief}.

It is a pleasure to thank Prof.~Kurt N.~Clausen, PSI, for his continuous
support to this project and for having initiated \MCS in the first
place. Essential support has also been given by Prof.~Robert McGreevy, ISIS.
We have also benefited from discussions with many other people in the neutron scattering
community, too numerous to mention here.

In case of errors, questions, or suggestions, do not hesitate to
contact the authors at \verb+mcstas-support@mcstas.org+
or consult the \MCS home page~\cite{mcstas_webpage}.
A special bug/request reporting service is available \cite{mczilla_webpage}.

The \MCS project has been supported by the European Union
through``XENNI / Cool Neutrons'' (FP4), ``SCANS'' (FP5),
``nmi3/MCNSI'' (FP6). \MCS was supported directly from the construction project for the ISIS second
target station (TS2/EU), see~\cite{ts2_webpage}. Currently \MCS is 
supported through Danish \emph{in-kind} work packages toward the
European Spallation Source (ESS), see~\cite{ess_webpage} and the
European Union through ``nmi3/E-learning'' and ``nmi3/MCNSI7'' (FP7) - see
the home pages~\cite{nmi3_webpage,mcnsi_webpage}.
