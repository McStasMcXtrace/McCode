Tk::CodeText.pm is a Tk::TextUndo widget with capabilities of syntax 
highlighting. At this moment only the Perl language is supported. The
highlight mechanism however, is of a plugin-type. Adding additional 
languages should be a matter of writing Tk::CodeText::MyLanguage modules.

The perl syntax module is based on and requires Syntax::Highlight::Perl;

This is the initial release. It has been written and tested on a
linux machine. It is untested for microsoft based machines or mac.
Please try it out on those machines and report your findings back to
me.

Not that you didn't know, but you install it like this:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	
and then as root

	make install


This software comes with no warranty whatsoever.
If it breaks you own both parts.
