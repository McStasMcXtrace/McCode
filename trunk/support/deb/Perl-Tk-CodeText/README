This directory contains a minimally patched Tk::CodeText from CPAN:

1) Added McStas.pm module from McStas
2) Removed Perl.pm module to not raise dependency for Syntax::Highlight::Perl
3) Removed Perl.pm related test
4) Resulting "original" tar.gz is now in libtk-codetext-perl_0.3.4.orig.tar.gz

To build a Debian package from this module, please install these packages:
apt-get install dh-make-perl devscripts

Then run these commands:

dh-make-perl Tk-CodeText-0.3.4

cd Tk-CodeText-0.3.4

debuild
