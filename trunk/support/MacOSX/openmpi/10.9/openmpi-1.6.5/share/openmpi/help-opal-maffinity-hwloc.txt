[invalid policy]
WARNING: An invalid value was given for the maffinity_libnuma_policy
MCA parameter.  The policy determines what happens when Open MPI tries
to allocate local memory, but no local memory is available.  The value
provided was:

  Value:      %s
  PID:        %d

Valid values are:

  strict: the memory allocation will fail
  loose:  the memory allocation will spill over to remote memory

Your job will now abort.
