# This is the US/English help file for Open MPI's SMTP notifier support
#
[command not specified]
Error: the Open MPI command notifier component had no command specified.
#
[bad command]
Error: the command notifier component received a bad command in the
notifier_command_cmd MCA parameter.  This usually means that there
are mismatched quotes in the command string.  Your MPI job may
continue, but the command notifier has been disabled.

  Local host: %s
  Command:    %s
#
[system call fail]
Error: a system call failed during the setup of the command notifier
component.  Open MPI is now going to abort your job.

  Local host:  %s
  System call: %s
  Errno:       %s (%d)
#
[grandchild fail]
The command notifier process died with a non-zero exit status.  This
should not happen.  Your MPI job will continue, however, and
notifications will attempt to continue.  But you may only see this
message once, even if notifications continue to fail.

  Local host:  %s
  Command:     %s
  Exit status: %s %d
#
[grandchild did not exit]
ERROR: The command notifier process took too long, but was unable to be
killed by Open MPI (Open MPI tried killing it with SIGTERM and
SIGKILL).  This should not happen; you should both check the host
where this occurred to see if there are any notifier processes still
running, and check your notifier command and ensure that it is
functioning properly.  Your MPI job will continue, however, and
notifications will attempt to continue.  But you may only see this
message once, even if notifications continue to fail.

  Local host:    %s
  Command:       %s
  Timeout (sec): %d
#
[grandchild timeout]
The command notifier process took too long and was killed by Open MPI.
This should not happen; you should check your notifier command and
ensure that it is functioning properly.  Your MPI job will continue,
however, and notifications will attempt to continue.  But you may only
see this message once, even if notifications continue to fail.

  Local host:    %s
