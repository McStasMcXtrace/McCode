[opal_init:startup:internal-failure]
It looks like opal_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during opal_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
Open MPI developer):

  %s failed
  --> Returned value %d instead of OPAL_SUCCESS
[opal_cr_init:no-crs]
It looks like opal_cr_init failed. This usually means that the CRS component
could not be activated on this machine. Check the installation of your
checkpointer, MCA parameters, and configuration. If all of that seems
correct, then copy this error message with the additional information below
to the Open MPI users list.
 Function:     %s
 Return value: %d
