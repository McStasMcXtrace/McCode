*
* Test instrument for SSW/SSR interface between McStas and MCNP
*
* %Description
* This instrument draws neutron events from a Source Surface file created using the
* MCNP Monte Carlo code and converts them to make them suitable for a McStas simulation.
* Assumes a file called 'rssa' is present in the run dir (or a symbolic link to a file).
* To produce 'rssa' file a MCNP simualtion must by run, using a SSW card. See 'MCNP_test_write'
* in the /examples
* After passing a slit at z=2m, events are written to the same format
*
* Note that axes orientation may be different between MCNP and McStas!
* Note also that the conversion of between McStas and MCNP units and parameters
* is done automatically by this component - but the user must ensure that
* geometry description matches between the two Monte Carlo codes.
*
* The verbose mode is highly recommended as it displays lots of useful informations.
*
* This interface uses the MCNP Source Surface Read/Write format (SSW/SSR).
* Infomation transfer from(to) SSW files proceeds via a set of Fortran modules
* and subroutines collected in "subs.f"
* For succesful compilation, it is required that these subroutines are compiled
* and linked to the instrument file:
*
* Example:
*
*  "mcstas SSRSSW_test.instr" gives: SSRSSW_test.c
*  "gfortran -c subs.f" gives:  subs.f
*  "gcc -o runme.out SSRSSW_test.c subs.o -lm -lgfortran" gives: runme.out
*  "./runme.out" runs the simulation example
*
* Note that this requires a fortran compiler (here gfortran) and gcc.
