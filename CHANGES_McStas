Changes in McStas v.2.3, April 6th, 2016

 McStas 2.3 is the fourth release in the 2.x series and fixes various issues with McStas 2.2a, plus 
 provides important new developments.

 IMPORTANT: Please ensure to use our "migration scripts" for McStas 2.0 and 1.12c if you want
 these to co-exist with 2.3. See https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/tree/master/tools/migration-tool
 Also, please read the platform-specific notes below!

 Thanks:
 - Thanks to all contributors of components, instruments etc.! This is what Open Source
   and McStas is all about!

 General:
 - As of McStas 2.3, we support a new binary event file format: "MCPL" (Monte Carlo Particle List), developed
   by Thomas Kittelmann, ESS. The format aims to allow easier interchange of particle event data between monte
   carlo codes, and read/write functionality has been implemented for MCNP, Geant4 and McStas.
 - Interoperability with Mantid has been improved, as OFF-based detectors can be used to define detector geometries
   in Mantid-oriented simulation runs. See https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki/McStas-and-Mantid for
   more documentation on the use.

 Infrastructure:
 - To build McStas from GitHub, you will now need a CMake version >= 3.0
 - At the ILL, Emmanuel Farhi has set up a nice web-service called cif2hkl, which allows to generate Laz/Lau
   structure data files from CIF files. See http://barns.ill.fr/cif2hkl.html
 - A new e-Learning infrastructure for neutron scattering has been set up at https://www.e-neutrons.org . Among
   other things, it features a web-simulator powered by McStas. Once you have signed up, you will have access
   to many interesting things, among these this "close to complete" list of McStas instruments that can be run
   on the web: https://www.e-neutrons.org/mcstas-distrib
 - We have started populating the McCode wiki at https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki with information
   for developers and others who want to work on the McStas code at a 'deeper' level.

 Components:
 - New component SASview_model.comp by Jakob Garde and Torben Nielsen allows to use SASview scattering kernels
   from within McStas. See also the test instrument templateSasView.instr
 - New component Diaphragm - an alias of the Slit comoponent
 - New components MCPL_input and MCPL_output by Erik Knudsen. Used to read and write MCPL binary event files. See
   corresponding test instruments below. 
 - New component Refractor.comp by Emmanuel Farhi and Bob Cubitt, ILL. Implements a single bulk material shape 
   that can be used as a prism or lens.
 - PerfectCrystal.comp by Markus Appel, ILL / FAU Erlangen-Nuernberg. Perfect crystal component, primarily for 
   use as monochromator and analyzer in backscattering spectrometers. Reflections are simulated using a Darwin, 
   Ewald or Gaussian profile. Doppler movement of the monochromator is supported.
 - MultiDiskChopper.comp by Markus Appel, ILL / FAU Erlangen-Nuernberg. Models a disk chopper with a freely 
   configurable slit pattern. For simple applications, use the DiskChopper component instead.
 - Updated version of Sample_nxs from Mirko Boin (HZB), including more nxs material definitions.
 - Bugfix to ESS_moderator from Jan Saroun (RESTRAX/Simres): missing focusing/direction cosine inserted. Please
   note that this component does not implement "engineering reality" and currently uses a coordinate system 
   centered on the moderator assembly. An updated moderator component which references the "Moderator focus 
   coordinate system" will be released later during the spring of 2016.
 - Bugfixes to numerous other components...
 
 Instruments:
 - New test instrument templateSasView.instr, documenting use of SASview_model.comp
 - New test instruments Test_MCPL_input.instr and Test_MCPL_output.instr, documenting use of the MCPL components
 - New test instrument Test_PowderN_Res.instr, demonstrates difference of using 'banana, theta' and 'banana, divergence'
   in Monitor_nD - and can be used to show influence of sample size on detected line with in diffractometers.
 - New test instrument LLB_6T2.instr by Xavier Fabreges, LLB. Model of the LLB 6T2 thermal single crystal
   diffractometer.
 - New ILL_IN13.instr by E. Farhi and A. Dennison, ILL. Models the IN13 Thermal neutron backscattering spectrometer.
 - New SAFARI_MPISI.instr by Deon Marais, Necsa. Models the SAFARI instrument 'Materials Probe for Internal Strain 
   Investigations'
 - New SAFARI_PITSI.instr by Deon Marais, Necsa. Models the SAFARI instrument 'Powder Instrument for Transition in 
   Structure Investigations'

 
 Datafiles:
 - cif2hkl service: At the ILL, Emmanuel Farhi has set up a nice web-service called cif2hkl, which allows to generate 
   Laz/Lau structure data files from CIF files. See http://barns.ill.fr/cif2hkl.html
 - New Sqw input data for H2O, D2O, He4, D2 by Emmanuel Farhi
 - UO2.laz powder definition included by Emmanuel Farhi
 - Further .nxs material definitions for Sample_nxs included
 - Furhter moderator defintion files for SNS made available

 Tools:
 - McStas 2.3 is the second release to include a version of our mcgui-py tool, based on Python, 
   QT and Scintilla. It has been made available across platforms, but without (yet) becoming the 
   default GUI application for McStas. Therefore, a few manual steps may be required to
   getting mcgui-py running on your platform:

   To install/try the new mcgui-py tool, please follow 
   the instructions listed below.
   * Debian Linux systems: 
     Simply apt-get install mcstas-tools-python-mcgui and dependencies should be autmatically resolved
   * RPM-based Linux systems:
     Use yum to install mcstas-tools-python-mcgui and dependencies should be autmatically resolved 
     (Tested to work for Fedora Core 21)
   * OS X:
     - Download and install Anaconda Python 2.7 (using the "for me only" option).
     - When installation is done, start a new terminal and locate the folder where you downloaded
       and unpacked the McStas installation bundle. Inside the extras/ folder you will find a subfolder
       called QScintilla/. 
     - Run the script BuildMe.command by typing "./BuildMe.command".
       (Browsing your way using Finder and double-clicking the BuildMe.command icon should also work)
     - NOTE: If your system prompts you to install command line tools: Accept to install. Afterwards, 
       run the script "BuildMe.command" again.
     - "mcgui-py" should now be available.
   * Windows:
     - Download and install Anaconda Python 2.7 and let it register as the default Python of your windows
       system. All dependencies should be included.

 - McStas 2.3 further includes the optional mcplot-gnuplot-py plotter based on Python and Gnuplot with 
   a Qt widget for control. On Mac OS X and Windows you need to install Gnuplot yourself, ensuring that the
   Gnuplot executable is available on the system PATH.


Changes in McStas v2.2a, May 29th, 2015

 McStas 2.2a is the third release in the 2.x series and fixes various minor issues with McStas 2.1,
 plus provide important new developments.

 IMPORTANT: Please ensure to use our "migration scripts" for McStas 2.0 and 1.12c if you want
 these to co-exist with 2.2a. See https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/tree/master/tools/migration-tool
 Also, please read the platform-specific notes below!

 Thanks:
 - Thanks to all contributors of components, instruments etc.! This is what Open Source
   and McStas is all about!
 - Thanks to Joachim Wuttke from FZ Jülich / MLZ for helping us update the TeX documentation!

 General:
 - Fix wrt. random number seed initialization when using MPI. (<-- The only difference wrt. 2.2)
 - The new component/instrument keyword DEPENDENCY allows to automatically require / compile instruments
   with external libraries, such as GSL in the case of Multilayer_sample (see ISIS_CRISP.instr). We foresee
   that this extension will see many great applications in the future.
 - The Mantid-IDF generation through our Perl mcdisplay tool has been optimized.
   For a "compact" i.e. source/sample/detector IDF use
       mcdisplay --format=Mantid ILL_H16_IN5_Mantid.instr -n0
   For a "full" IDF (also including visualisation of neutron optics etc use
       mcdisplay --format=Mantid --complete ILL_H16_IN5_Mantid.instr -n0
 - The use of WHEN with EXTEND code only considered the first statement (report by M. Appel). Fixed.

 Infrastructure:
 - McStas (and its X-ray counterpart McXtrace) are now on GitHub, see
   https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode
 - We will continually provide various bits of "missing information" on the related Wiki at
   https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki
 - If you want to contribute instrument models or components, the future way of doing that is to
   fork / clone our GitHub repo, make your changes and send us a pull-request
 - We will later provide a "cheat sheet" - McStas and GitHub for physicist... :-)

 Components:
 - A new model for the ESS butterfly moderator - see documentation for the ESS_moderator.comp. Developed by
   Peter Willendrup in close collaboration with Troels Schoenfeldt DTU Nutech/ESS.
   ** A separate document with recommended settings for this component will be released later **
 - the Isotropic_Sqw component was broken in McStas 2.1. The expected behaviour has been restored. 
   Users of this component should upgrade to McStas 2.2a asap. Sorry for the inconvenience.
 
 Instruments:
 - ILL_IN13 backscattering instrument contributed by Emmanuel Farhi
 - ILL_IN4 tof instrument contributed by Emmanuel Farhi
 - ILL_IN6 fixed time window (was too narrow, causing under-estimate of energy resolution)
 
 Datafiles:
 - Improved water Sqw data files contributed by Emmanuel Farhi (- see also JNST 52 (2015) 844 )
 - Added CaF2 crystal, improved Al2O3 sapphire transmission

 Tools:
 - McStas 2.2a is the first release to include a first version of our new mcgui-py tool, based on Python, 
   QT and Scintilla, work done by new McStas team member Jakob Garde. We think it is a very nice start
   at this long-awaited replacement of mcgui (Perl) and want you to try it out even though a few edges
   may still be rough here and there. We therefore make it available across platforms, but without (yet)
   making it the default GUI application for McStas. Therefore, a few manual steps may be required to
   getting mcgui-py running on your platform:

   To install/try the new mcgui-py tool, please follow 
   the instructions listed below.
   * Debian Linux systems: 
     Simply apt-get install mcstas-tools-python-mcgui and dependencies should be autmatically resolved
   * RPM-based Linux systems:
     Use yum to install mcstas-tools-python-mcgui and dependencies should be autmatically resolved 
     (Tested to work for Fedora Core 21)
   * OS X:
     - Download and install Anaconda Python 2.7 (using the "for me only" option).
     - When installation is done, start a new terminal and locate the folder where you downloaded
       and unpacked the McStas installation bundle. Inside the extras/ folder you will find a subfolder
       called QScintilla/. 
     - Run the script BuildMe.command by typing "./BuildMe.command".
       (Browsing your way using Finder and double-clicking the BuildMe.command icon should also work)
     - NOTE: If your system prompts you to install command line tools: Accept to install. Afterwards, 
       run the script "BuildMe.command" again.
     - "mcgui-py" should now be available.
   * Windows:
     - Download and install Anaconda Python 2.7 and let it register as the default Python of your windows
       system. All dependencies should be included.

 - McStas 2.2a further includes a simple mcplot plotter for Unix platforms (Linux, OS X) based solely on 
   shell-script + Matlab/iFit/Octave, no need for Perl or Python with this plotter, called mcplot-matlab


Changes in McStas v2.1, September, 2014

 McStas 2.1 is the second release in the 2.x series and fixes various issues with McStas 2.0,
 plus provide important new developments.

 IMPORTANT: Please ensure to use our "migration scripts" for McStas 2.0 and 1.12c if you want
 these to co-exist with 2.1. Also, please read the platform-specific notes below!

 Thanks:
 - Thanks to all contributors of components, instruments etc.! This is what Open Source
   and McStas is all about!
 - Thanks to Jonas Stein from Uni Cologne for helping us modernize the TeX documentation!
 
 General:
 - Via NeXus libraries and a new --format=Mantid setting for the mcdisplay tool, we are now
   able to generate NeXus/HDF files that can be read and treated by Mantid! Mcdisplay generates
   a Mantid IDF description for embedding in the NeXus file, including the usual McStas instrument
   geometry. Please read the specific guide for this method, documented in the McStas manual, Chapter 6.
 - Use of STATE_PARAMETERS and POLARIZATION parameters is no longer supported!
   If you have home-grown components using these, you will get this type of error with 
   McStas 2.1:

      Translating instrument definition 'BNL_H8.instr' into C ...
      mcstas -t -o BNL_H8.c BNL_H8.instr
      Compiling simulation BNL_H8.instr
      Arm.comp is using STATE PARAMETERS
      	       mcstas-2.1 does NOT support this keyword. Please remove line 36
      mcstas-2.1: 1 Errors encountered during parse of BNL_H8.instr.
      ** Error exit **

      
   As the error message suggests, this can be fixed by simply removing/commenting out
   the STATE and POLARISATION parameter lines in the top of the component, i.e.:
   /* STATE PARAMETERS (x,y,z,vx,vy,vz,t,s1,s2,p) */
   /* POLARISATION PARAMETERS (sx,sy,sz) */
   
 - In case of "negative time" propagation we no longer ABSORB these neutrons but rather restore
   the incoming neutron state, leaving it untouched for the following components. This avoids
   various types of shadowing effects, e.g. when placing parallel monitors that are not in a 
   GROUP. This is furhter in preparation for the forthcoming ASSEMBLY keyword which will work
   roughly like an "iterative group" that loops on the ASSEMBLY of components until no furhter
   scattering is achieved, but always scatters first on the component which is closest (in time)
   to the neutron.

 - "Scatter logging": With this release we provide this special ensemble of instrument examples
   - Test_Scatter_log_losses.instr
   - Test_Scatter_log_mvalues.instr
   - Test_Scatter_log_ssw_mcnp.instr
   that together with the (misc cathegory) components
   - Scatter_log_iterator.comp
   - Scatter_log_iterator_stop.comp
   - Scatter_logger.comp
   - Scatter_logger_stop.comp
   provide a powerful post-processing mechanism, mainly for guide systems - that for instance
   can be used to study the non-propagated, i.e. absorbed neutron flux along the guide. For
   more information, a paper by Esben Klinkby et. al. will be available in one of the next 
   issues of Journal of Physics: Conference Series, proceedings of the NOP&D 2013 meeting in
   Ismaning. Slides from Esbens talk are available here:
   http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/57025387/prod11375088187360.NO_P_v8.pdf

 - As of this release, McStas is distributed using easy-to-use meta-packages for the Windows
   and Mac OS X systems. (these already existed for the deb and rpm based Linux packages, see
   below) The content of these packages are:

   * Windows:
     - See http://www.mcstas.org/download/install_windows for details
     - Strawberry Perl (including a gcc compiler)
     - Perl PPD extensions for PDL, PGPLOT and Tk
     - The core mcstas package
     - The mcstas component package, with comps, instruments, datafiles
     - The mcstas Perl tools package with mcgui, mcplot etc.
     - The mcstas manuals package with PDF docs
     - For VRML and X3D viewing of instruments, we recommend Instant Player from
       http://www.instantreality.org
     - ! The mcstas Python tool packages are installed by default, but if you want to 
       make use of our OPTIONAL Python based packages, their dependencies need to be installed
       by hand !
       - Needed dependencies for the Python packages are all available in the Python(x,y)
       	 package available from https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/

   - ! We are only distributing a 32bit package for windows, since we feel the 64-bin gcc on
       windows is not mature - gives problems in a few, specific cases. In any case, the 32-bit
       McStas for windows works perfectly fine on a 64-bit operating system !  

   - ! If you experience strange behavior from perl/mcgui on Windows like
       	    a) ppm shell not being able to install the extra Perl packages
            b) mcgui not being able to run / compile a simulation (all you get is mcrun -- help output)
     	    c) mcgui not being able to access local component files
	  - Solution can be to ensure your user has "full control" to the executables in
	    c:\strawberry\perl\bin (Right-click, Properties, Security, Authenticated users -> Edit)

   * Mac OS X:
     - IMPORTANT: Please ensure to use our "migration scripts" for McStas 2.0 and 1.12c if you want
       these to co-exist with 2.1. They MUST be applied before installing 2.1!
     - See http://www.mcstas.org/download/install_mac_os_x for details
     - A McStas 'app' bundle in /Applications/McStas-2.1.app - you can uninstall all of McStas 2.1
       by dragging this bundle to the trash bin.
     - Tk perl package for mcgui
     - SciPDL package for mcplot, including the core pgplot package
     - The core mcstas package
     - The mcstas component package, with comps, instruments, datafiles
     - The mcstas Perl tools package with mcgui, mcplot etc.
     - The mcstas manuals package with PDF docs
     - For VRML and X3D viewing of instruments, we recommend Instant Player from
       http://www.instantreality.org
     - ! If you want to use our OPTIONAL Python based packages, select these for installation
       in the Metapackage installer !
       - For the Python mcrun, you need to install PyYAML from http://www.pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML
       - Most other needed dependencies for the Python packages are available through the 
       	 SciPy superpack available from http://fonnesbeck.github.io/ScipySuperpack/
       - You may also choose the commerical Anaconda or Enthought Python distributions
       
   - ! The install location of the McStas components and libraries on Mac OS X has changed! Your files
       are now placed in /Applications/McStas-2.1.app/Contents/Resources/mcstas/2.1/ - but for ease
       of use, a link is also available in /usr/local/mcstas/2.1/ (Note that we have dropped 'lib' in 
       that path.) Links to binaries are in /usr/local/bin.

   * For Linux (Debian and RPM based)
     - IMPORTANT: Please ensure to use our "migration scripts" for McStas 2.0 and 1.12c if you want
       these to co-exist with 2.1. They MUST be applied before installing 2.1! 
     - See http://www.mcstas.org/download/install_linux for details
     - For some RPM based systems, you may futher need to install the EPEL extensions, see https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL
     - For Deb and RPM type systems we provide a set of APT and YUM repositories. Simply follow the
       instructions on the link provided to add the relevant repository to your Linux.
     - Afterwards, simply choose to install mcstas-suite-perl (perl tools), mcstas-suite-python 
       (python tools) or mcstas-suite (both toolsets) and all dependencies should be taken care of.

   - ! The install location of the McStas components and libraries on Linux X has changed! 
       * On Debian, your files are now placed in /usr/share/mcstas/2.1/ - links to binaries are in /usr/bin
       * On RedHat, your files are now placed in /usr/local/mcstas/2.1/ - links to binaries are in /usr/local/bin
       (Note that we have dropped 'lib' in the mcstas system path.)


  
 - A given McStas 2.x release is "self-contained" and can be installed in parallel with other versions
   of McStas and McXtrace 
 - We provide a "migration tool" for Unix based systems (i.e. Linux & Mac) to let your already
   installed McStas 1.x or 2.0 co-exist with the new 2.1
 - Using McStas with NeXus does no longer require recompilation if you only want to _write_ NeXus.
   (Simply install NeXus and update your MCSTAS_CFLAGS to include -lNeXus -DUSE_NEXUS). For the
   conversion of files using mcformat NeXus must still be available at compile time

 Core & runtime code:
 - Backward compatibility 1: As written above, STATE and POLARIZATION parameters are no longer supported!
 - Complete rework of the DETECTOR_OUT infrastructure:
   * Simplified code-structure
   * Proper support for MPI when generating NeXus event lists
 - New logic wrt. negative time propagation: Neutrons are restored rather than ABSORB'ed
 - Improvement of the interpolation routines e.g. for magnetic fields: search is performed roughly in constant time
 - Read_Table: better search for files, including from full executable path, from source.instr location, from 
   PWD and from McCode lib.
 - ref-lib.c: If components use alpha=0 and w=0 in parametrizing the reflectivity, the StdReflecFunc
   applies a phenomenological fit of Swiss Neutronics mirrors (above m=3 including a 2nd order beta term). The fits
   were done by Henrik Jacobsen, University of Copenhagen.

 Tools:
 - Since 2.0 mcgui Perl and mcrun Python has been generating time-stamped output directories if no output dir 
   was specified. The legacy mcrun Perl now exhibit this behavior also. This is balanced by the possiblitiy
   to choose . (dot) as the output directory - then the legacy behaviour of storing data in the working
   directory is enabled.

 Documentation:
 - Modernized and facelifted TeX documentation in the manuals, which include slightly updated Component manual.
   A few components-docs parameter tables are now extracted from mcdoc and included in the manual. 

 New Components:
 - Rotator and Derotator - components that allow a section of the instrument to rotate in time.
 - New ESS_moderator component by P Willendrup, E Klinkby and T Schoenfeldt DTU
   * new ess_source-lib with brilliance defintitions corresponding to Mezei 2001, TDR and 2014 brilliances
   * support for geometrical brilliance variation (i.e. "pancake" geometry)
   * much simplified input-parameter setup
   * various fixes wrt. McStas 2.0 and later updated source modules
 - Monitor_Sqw - generates an Sqw between a sample and a detector, a kind of inelastic resolution monitor.

 Updated Components:
 - Single_crystal and PowderN have both been optimized for speed - especially in connection with using
   the SPLIT keyword:
     * The first precomputations relating to structure and crossections is kept for each incoming netron,
       so that the component may skip these calculations for the next SPLIT version of the neutron (there
       is a built-in check for whether that kind of neutron was processed before). This means that a set'
       of SPLIT neutron may be scattered across ALL reflection that are allowed for that specific incoming
       direction and wavelength. Further, the components estimate the optimal value of the SPLIT. For large
       single crystal unit cells (i.e. protein crystals etc.), speedups of a factor of 500 have been observed!
       The method works with all orders of scattering, even though the largest gain is seen with order=1.
     * Use is easy, e.g.
          SPLIT 43 COMPONENT SX=Single_crystal(order=1, ...)
 - Single_crystal now allows to be used as a Powder, mainly for benchmarking purposes - at the point of scattering,
   the "crystallite" is randomly oriented. Final validation is pending, but in this setting, the component already
   gives the same order of manitude scattering as PowderN, where this powder ring "intergration" has been 
   implemented using a completely different strategy - provided the right values of mosaicity and delta_d_d are
   given!
 - ISIS moderator component allow specification of the accellerator current. The component performance
   defaults to the actual, relevant accellerator setting for each target station (TS). All TS1 and TS2

Changes in McStas v2.0, December 21st, 2012

 McStas 2.0 is the long-awaited major release of McStas

 Thanks:
 - Thanks to all contributors of components, instruments etc.! This is what Open Source
   and McStas is all about!
 - Thanks to Johan Brinch for helping us modernize the structure of the code and bring
   new solutions in the tool area!
 - Thanks to Esben Klinkby for debugging results of the McStas (physics) test!

 General:
 - As documented in the manual, a new major release means loss of backward compatibility.
   See remarks below about STATE_PARAMETERS and naming of component parameters. Most of your
   existing instruments and components should be trivial to port to the new release as the
   code generation gives you helpful debugging information. Should you fail after trying, 
   feel free to send us a tgz or zip with all needed instrument- and component code to 
   mcstas-users@mcstas.org and we will try to help.
 - As of this release, McStas is distributed as multiple packages rather than a monolithic:
   - mcstas, contains code generator and runtime codes
     * Dependencies: a C-compiler (and mcstas-comps)
     * Optional: an MPI environment
   - mcstas-comps, contains component- and instrument example libraries 
     * Dependencies: mcstas
   - mcstas-tools-Perl, contains our "legacy" set of perl tools 
     * Dependencies: mcstas, Perl, Perl::Tk, pgplot, perl-PGPLOT, Gnuplot
     * Optional: Perl::Tk::CodeText, Perl::Math::Amoeba, Matlab, a VRML-viewer, (Scilab 4.0)
     * Remark: As far as possible, we provide dependencies in the installation bundles
     * Remark: mcgui can be configured to run python-based tools for sub-tasks
   - mcstas-doc, contains our PDF manuals
   - mcstas-tools-Python-mcrun, contains our new, python-based compile/run script
     * Dependencies: python-yaml
     * Remark: The script falls back to the perl version if dependencies do not resolve
   - mcstas-tools-Python-mcplot-matplotlib, contains a new matplotlib mcplot solution
     * Dependencies: python-matplotlib
     * Remark: A bit on the slow side for large datasets
     * Remark: Features zooming on individual plots
     * Remark: "Standard" mcplot shortcuts for graphics dumps etc.
     * Remark: Recommendations for platform-specific python-distributions below
     * Remark: The script falls back to the perl version if dependencies do not resolve
   - mcstas-tools-Python-mcplot-chaco, contains a draft implementation of mcplot based on chaco
     * Dependencies: python-chaco
     * Remark: Faster than matplotlib-solution, but a bit on the slow side for large datasets
     * Remark: Features zooming on individual plots
     * Remark: Recommendations for platform-specific python-distributions below
     * Remark: Not easy to install dependencies for chaco if not in your python distro
     * Remark: The script falls back to the perl version if dependencies do not resolve
   - mcstas-web, contains a webserver-based run/trace/plot solution
     * Dependencies: python, python-XXX, R or perl+pgplot+perl-PGPLOT, nginx or apache
     * Remark: Currently not packaged, get it from our SVN.
 - In the future, we will release new versions of e.g. the component library, docs or tools while 
   maintaining the core mcstas package. See repository-remarks below.
 - A given McStas 2.x release is "self-contained" and can be installed in parallel with other of
   McStas and McXtrace (i.e. run mcgui-2.0RC2 to select a specific version)
 - We provide the new mccode-select and mccode-select-bundle that allows to select the version of
   a given tool (i.e. mcrun) which is run by default 
 - We provide a "migration tool" for Unix based systems (i.e. Linux & Mac) to let your already
   installed McStas 1.x co-exist with the new 2.x 
 - Using McStas with NeXus does no longer require recompilation if you only want to _write_ NeXus.
   (Simply install NeXus and update your MCSTAS_CFLAGS to include -lNeXus -DUSE_NEXUS). For the
   conversion of files using mcformat NeXus must still be available at compile time

 Platform support:
 - We have moved from autoconf+make to CMake for easy multi-platform support
 - Supported platforms / targeted distributions of McStas are available for
   - Debian-based Linux systems (including Ubuntu, Mint etc.)
     * Versions: 32 and 64 bit
     * Remark: Dependencies resolved through OS package system
     * Remark: We provide debian packages for dependencies that are not in the OS'es by default
     * Remark: On Debian you need to enable the 'non-free' and 'contrib' apt-repositories
     * Remark: We will soon provide an apt repository for your sources.list
   - RPM-based Linux systems (including Scientific Linux, CentOS etc.)
     * Versions: 32 and 64 bit
     * Remark: Dependencies resolved through OS package system
     * Remark: For most of these distros you will need to enable the RPMforge and EPEL repositories.
       	       See e.g.: http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect-server-centos-6.3-x86_64-nginx-courier-ispconfig-3-p3
     * Remark: We provide RPM or SRPM packages for dependencies that are not in the OS'es by default
     * Remark: We will soon provide an RPM repository for your yum
     * Remark: The 'python-chaco' dependency for the chaco-mcplot is not easily available here
   - Mac OS X, through a set of .pkg packages
     * Versions: Independent 64 bit versions for 10.6 Snow Leopard, 10.7 Lion and 10.8 Mountain Lion. 
       	       Older versions are not directly supported, but installation should be possible if you 
	       build from the SVN tree using cmake.
     * Remark: On 10.6 you need to install a compatible Xcode - available from http://developer.apple.com
       	       or use the one on your original installation medium.
     * Remark: On 10.7 and 10.8 you need to get Xcode from the App store and through the in-app preferences
       	       download the 'Command Line Tools'.
     * Remark: On 10.8 you need to install XQuartz from	http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/
     * Remark: We distribute dmg images for each supported target release of OS X including all other
       	       bits you need for runing McStas and the Perl tools. Follow instructions in the README file. 
     * Remark: To run the python-mcrun tool you need to install python-yaml via Terminal.app and this commmand:
               sudo easy_install pyyaml
     * Remark: To run the python-mcplot tools you need to either get
       	       a) Enthought Python (Commercial Python distribution) from http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php .
	       	  This enables both the matplotlib and chaco based mcplot tools. You need to make the installed 
		  python the system-default python 2.7, the instructions from Enthought:
		  http://www.enthought.com/products/epdgetstart.php?platform=mac#default
	       b) SciPy superpack from http://fonnesbeck.github.com/ScipySuperpack/ . This enables the 
	          matplotlib mcplot tool with the default Python available on OS X.
   - Microsoft Windows systems
     * Versions: 32 and 64 bit, tested on XP, Windows 7 and Windows 8
     * Remark: We distribute zip files for each 32 and 64 bit Windows independently. Follow instructions 
       	       in the README file. 
     * Remark: We recommend using Strawberry Perl (v. 5.16) and provide compatible ppd's for the various
               perl-tool dependencies (perl-PDL, pgplot, perl-PGPLOT, perl-Tk-CodeText, perl-Math-Amoeba).
	       Get Strawberry Perl via http://strawberryperl.com
     * Remark: Strawberry Perl includes gcc! Hence no need to install a separate c-compiler!
     * Remark: For MPI parallelization, we recommend installing MPICH2 from http://www.mpich.org
     * Remark: We recommend Python(x,y) on Windows systems as it includes both matplotlib and chaco. Get
       	       Python(x,y) via http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/
     * Remark: To enable the Python based mcrun tool with Python(x,y) you need to install PyYAML from
       	       http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML
     * Remark: Windows installations now recide in e.g. c:\mcstas-2.0RC2 and we provide two version-
               dependent desktop links: mcgui-2.0RC2 and mcstas-environment-2.0RC2 (the latter for running 
	       simulations using the windows cmd.exe). We do not touch the system registry for setting up 
	       PATH's etc., all is handled from the two links/batch files.
 - As far as possible, we build the packages on "standard" versions of the relevant OS'es (with the exception
   of the windows builds that are created on Debian Linux via cross-compilation)

 Tools
 - Many new developments as mentioned above. Just to name a few:
   - New mcrun tool based on Python
   - New mcplot tool based on Python+matplotlib
   - New mcplot tool baded on Python+chaco
   - New web-frontend based on Python
   - Mcgui perl-tool has been refurbished, updated look plus new button for changing working dir

 Core & runtime code:
 - Backward compatibility 1: Some backward-compatibility is lost in the new version of the code-generation, 
   as we no longer use the information defined in the component STATE_PARAMETERS and POLARISATION_PARAMETERS
   macros. A warning is issued in case of components using these macros, e.g.:
   Warning:  /usr/local/lib/mcstas-2.0delta/monitors/TOF2Q_cylPSD_monitor.comp is using STATE PARAMETERS
    mcstas-2.0delta 2.0delta support is PARTIAL for these and support will END with next release
 - Backward compatibility 2: We have standardized naming of component parameters - see the file NOMENCLATURE
   installed in the McStas library. The code generation will give error messages of e.g. using xw and yh where
   one should now be using xwidth and yheight.
 - Support for tabulated magnetic fields. New code for handling interpolation in sparse data is included 
   in the share/interpolation/ area. The test instrument Test_pol_tabled.instr takes use of this feature. 
   The curren implementation is in draft status, we expect speedup in the next McStas release.

 New Components:
 - Sample_nxs.comp from Mirko Boin, HZB. Diffraction/imaging oriented sample where one defines the structure
   by means of the NXS crystallography library which is now also included with McStas. The component comes with the test-
   instruments Test_Sample_nxs_diffraction.instr and Test_Sample_nxs_imaging.instr.

Changes in McStas v1.12c, June 3rd, 2011

 McStas 1.12c is bugfix release.

 Bugfixes include:

  Runtime
  - Fix of a bug in the rectangular focusing routine, reported to mcstas-users by Markos Skoulatos, HZB
    (see http://mailman.mcstas.org/pipermail/mcstas-users/2010q4/000845.html)
  - Introduction of --ncount as unsigned long long int in place of double. Using double could potentially lead 
    simulations to "hang". A re-release of McStas 1.12c was done due to bugs in components related to the new
    type returned from mcget_ncount.

  Tools
  - If gnuplot is available at installation time, mcplot and mcgui can use this in place of PGPLOT.
    To use gnuplot, either
    - edit your mcstas_config.perl and put      PLOTTER => 'Gnuplot',
    - set the enviroment variable MCSTAS_FORMAT to Gnuplot

  Components
  - Lens.comp, typo in author name corrected
  - Guide_four_side.comp (and other similar), by Tobias Panzner updated
  - Single_crystal.comp, corrected initialization when providing lattice consts and angles

  - Monochromator_pol.comp, now works properly in GROUPS/multi-slab configurations
  - Pol_simpleBfield.comp, potential polarisation exit-state bug corrected
  - FermiChopper.comp, fixed error when computing automatic phase 
  - Monitor_nD.comp, fixed geometry bugs reported by Lambert van Eijck
  
  
  Example instruments
  - ESS_IN5_reprate.instr, parameter naming change in ESS_moderator_long component was not accomodated.
  - templateTAS.instr, fixes relating to inclusion in other instrument files

Changes in McStas v1.12, May 8th, 2008

  Metalanguage
  - New %include "instr" mechanism to include one instrument in another. (Useful for independent
     build-up of e.g. primary and secondary spectrometer. Or easily see the effect of moving an instrument
     to a different beamport or facility!) See the manual for details.
  - When applying the WHEN keyword, an applied EXTEND %{ %} block will only be active if the WHEN
     returns 'true'.
  - Please take care when combining WHEN, GROUP and EXTEND %{ %} - see the manual.

  Runtime
  - Fix of a limiting case focusing problem reported to mcstas-users by George Apostolopoulos.
     ( See http://mailman.risoe.dk/pipermail/neutron-mc/2007q4/002915.html )

  Components
  - When using the Virtual_input type components, --ncount is always set to an integer multiplum 
     (repeat_count) of the number of events in the file. See also related remark about MPI below.
  - New component: MirrorElli.comp, elliptical mirror. Contributed by Sylvain Desert, LLB
  - New component: MirrorPara.comp, parabolic mirror. Contributed by Sylvain Desert, LLB
  - Single_crystal validation still ongoing, but has progressed: The algorithm seems OK, but is to some
     extent not in sync with the documentation. New option to specify reciprocal space vectors directly.
     (before only real space definitions were possible)
  - Most monitors now allow to 'not propagate' the neutron, i.e. not influence the beam. Parameter name
     is 'restore_neutron'.
   
  Example instruments
  - ILL_H25_IN22_sample/_resolution.instr (CRG instrument @ ILL) by E. Farhi / P. Willendrup
  - Incoherent_Test.instr - instrument to compare incoherent scattering from the different sample comps
     (V_samle, PowderN, Single_crystal, Isotropic_sqw). More instruments of this type planned (compare
     guides etc.), P. Willendrup / E. Knudsen / A. Daoud-Aladine
  - FocalisationMirrors.instr - test instrument for MirrorElli and MirrorPara, Sylvain Desert, LLB
  - PSI_DMC.instr, Powder Diffractometer, PSI, L. Keller / U. Filges / P. Willendrup

  Datafiles
  - 'Bugfix', some of the provided .laz files did not have proper unit for |F2|.

  - Support for per-user mcstas_config.perl file, located in $HOME/.mcstas/ . This folder is also the default
     location of the 'host list' for use with MPI or gridding, simply name the file 'hosts'.
  - mcgui Save Configuration for saving chosen settings on the 'Configuration options' and 'Run dialogue'.
  - Possibilty to run MPI or grid simulations by default from mcgui.
  - When scanning parameters, mcrun now terminates with a relevant error message if one or more scan steps
     failed (intensities explicitly set to 0 in those cases).
  - When running parameter optimisations, a logfile (default name is "mcoptim_XXXX.dat" where XXXX is a
     pseudo-random string) is created during the optimisation, updated at each optim step.
  - We now provide syntax-highlighting setup files for vim and gedit editors.

  Output formats
  - Rudimentary support for GNUPLOT when plotting with mcplot. Data file format is standard McStas/PGPLOT.
 
  Platform support
  - Mac OS X 10.3 Panther (ppc), 10.4 Tiger (pcc/intel), 10.5 Leopard (ppc/intel)
  - Windows XP,  Windows Vista (Now with a recent perl version; 5.10 plus various fixes). New feature on Windows:
     Simulations _always_ run in the background, freeing mcgui for other work.
  - "Any" Linux - reference platforms are Ubuntu 8.04 (and earlier) and Debian 4.0 (and earlier). We have also tested 
     Fedora 8, OpenSuSE 10.3 and CentOS 4 releases recently.
  - FreeBSD (FreeBSD release 6.3 and its cousin DesktopBSD 1.6 recently tested)
  - SUN Solaris 10 (Intel tested, Sparc probably OK)
  - Plus probably any UNIX/POSIX type environment with a bit of effort...
  
  Parallelisation
  - Improved stability of MPI simulations by addition of an 'MPI barrier' (reduces probability of nodes beeing 'out of sync'.
  - On Windows, an 'mpicc.bat' script has been added for easier setup of McStas with gcc and MPI (We recommend MPICH).
  - Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard is shipped with built-in support for MPI (OpenMPI). No need to install extra packages.
  - Use of 'virtual sources' is now supported on MPI clusters. (If running on N nodes, all neutron events will be processed
     on each of the N nodes - implicit repetition N times of the source contents.)
  - OpenMP threading support 
  - Much improved gridding support (via ssh). Ready for heterogenous systems, e.g. mixed operating systems and hardware
     types! (Requires -c compile flag for mcrun or equivalent setting in mcgui.) The only requirement is ssh client on the machine 
     where the grid run is started, plus ssh daemon and c-compiler (e.g. gcc or simply cc) on the remote machines. Files in the 
     current dir are transparently copied back and forth, causes a substantial network traffic in some cases. Output data from the 
     nodes are automatically merged using mcformat. Just as efficient as MPI without any library dependencies at all. Make use 
     of all processer cores in your machine, simply choose to 'grid'. Windows 'client' host OK, we autodetect ssh and scp binaries
     from the Putty package.

  Various
  - A number of minor bugs ironed out, both in components, runtime code and tools.
  - From release 1.12, McStas is GPL 2 only. The debate on the internet about the future GPL 3 license suggests that this license 
     might have implications on the 'derived work', hence have implications on what and how our users use their McStas simulations
     for. To protect user freedom, we will stick with GPL 2.     

  WARNING: The 'dash' shell which is used as /bin/sh on some Linux system (Including Ubuntu 8.04) makes the 'Cancel' and 'Update' 
  buttons fail in mcgui. Solutions:
  a) If your system is a Debian or Ubuntu, please dpkg-reconfigure dash and say 'no' to install dash as /bin/sh
  b) If you run another Linux with /bin/sh beeing dash, please install bash and manually change the /bin/sh link to point at bash.

Changes in McStas v1.11, July 3rd, 2007

  Metalanguage
  - New SPLIT keyword for improving statistics. WARNING: Follow instructions in the documentation for safe
    use of the SPLIT keyword. 

  Components
  - Source_adapt.comp, additions by Aaron Percival which allows to specify a flat wavlength distibution.
  - Single_crystal.comp, warning NOT to use this component as a monochromator (bug fix/validation under way).
  - PowderN.comp, can now be used in concentric mode, i.e. for modelling sample surroundings (cryostat, container..).
  - Tunneling_sample.comp (new) Double-cylinder shaped all-incoherent scatterer with elastic, quasielastic (Lorentzian)
    and tunneling (sharp) components. No multiple scattering. Absorbtion included. By Kim Lefmann
  - TOF2E_monitor.comp (new) TOF-sensitive monitor, converting to energy. By Kim Lefmann

  Example instruments
  - New ILL_H15_IN6 and ILL_H142_IN12 instruments by Emmanuel Farhi are included.
  - Histogrammer.instr - see the 'Tools' section
  - New ESS_IN5_reprate.instr Instrument for simulating IN5-TYPE (cold chopper) multi-frame spectrometer at ESS LPT.
    (Also example instrument for Tunneling_sample.comp.) By  Kim Lefmann

  Datafiles
  - Reflectivity curves from Swiss Neutronics (more work done, available in the next McStas release).
  - More Sqw tables for use with the Isotropic_Sqw component.

  Tools
  - PGPLOT output format (original McStas format) is now possible on Windows. A pgplot/pgperl installation
    is included in a standard McStas Win32 installation.
  - New mcdaemon for visualisation of intermediate simulation results (obtained by sending USR2 signal to a 
    running simulation or by using the Progress_bar component with flag_save=1).
  - Improvements to mcgui:
    * New tool menu with hooks to mcformat, mcdaemon and mcplot
    * Possibility for auto-setup of MPI ssh keys
    * Possibility to run the McStas editor in 'detached' mode, hence available whilst a simulation is running
  - Histogrammer.instr: Special histogramming instrument for visualisation of virtual source files (Virtual_input,
    VitESS, MCNP and Tripoli formats)

  Output formats
  - NeXus output format possible. To use this feature, HDF and NeXus libraries must be available
    and functional on your system before installing McStas from source. (In case of a binary package, 
    you MUST recompile the McStas software.) To enable a McStas build with NeXus, run 
    ./configure --with-nexus.

  Platform support
  - Mac OS X is now considered a supported platform. For now, no actuall installer program
    is given, but all needed software has been packed together with easy to follow instructions.
    Test of the instructions have been performed on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger on both Intel and PPC
    hardware.
  - McStas now comes in a Debian binary package (.deb), tested to work on Debian and Ubuntu systems. The debian
    package provides McStas, pgplot and pgperl and have dependencies for the perl, perl-tk, gcc, libg2c0, pdl and libc6-dev 
    packages.

  Parallelisation
  - The threading mechanism for parallelisation has been removed from McStas since it caused too many problems. For 
    parallelisation on single machines (e.g. modern dual-core processors) or clusters, MPI (MPICH) is the recommended solution.
    The McStas team members routinely run developer machines and clusters using MPI.

  Intel C compiler
  - The documentation now includes instructions to run McStas with the Intel C compiler (available on Windows,
    Linux x86 and Mac OS x86 systems). Typically, a performance gain of 2 is found relative to gcc -O2. Relevant
    compiler flags are:

    MCSTAS_CFLAGS="-g -O2 -wd177,266,1011,181"
    export MCSTAS_CC="icc"

  - To run McStas with MPI and the Intel C compiler, you may have to edit your mpicc shell script to set:
    
    CC="icc"

  Various
  - A standard McStas source package now works directly within the DANSE framework.

  WARNING: The 'dash' shell which is used as /bin/sh on some Linux system (Including Ubuntu 7.04) makes the 'Cancel' and 'Update' 
  buttons fail in mcgui. Solutions:
  a) If your system is a Debian or Ubuntu, please install our Debian package which requests automatic removal of 'dash'.
  b) If your /bin/sh is dash, please install bash and manually change the /bin/sh link to point at bash.

Changes in McStas v1.10, Dec 4, 2006

  General
  - This release is a major step forward for McStas in terms of support for polarisation.
    Peter Christiansen who worked at Risoe March-October 2006 was the main workforce 
    behind this new functionality, backed by funding from ISIS, work by Rob Dalgliesh at 
    ISIS and inspiration from the VitESS and NISP packages. As this is the first release
    with polarisation support, the methods and algorithms implemented will certainly be 
    developed further. Hence, documentation of the functionality has been placed in an 
    appendix to the manual. 
    Polarisation users: Please give us feedback for further development!
    Items marked by (p) below relate to the new polarisation support.
  - New keywords for the meta language improves support for e.g. description of sample
    enviroments.
  - A method for automatic optimisation has been implemented, e.g. for achieving maximum flux
    at the sample position (any quantity measured by a McStas monitor can be optimised) as a
    function of simulation parameters.
  - Bugfixes in many different areas.

  Documentation
  - Manual and component manual slightly updated according to adding/modification of components
    and functionality. New appendix on the polarisation features. (p)

  Kernel
  - New WHEN keyword, conditional use of components,
        COMPONENT MyComp=Component(...) WHEN (condition) AT
  - New JUMP keyword, possibility to iterate a given component a number of times (multiple 
    scattering) or for 'teleportation' to a given component. (USE WITH CAUTION)
  - Improved COPY keyword with parameter substitution (Make a copy of an other component 
    instance with a few parameters changed)
  - Spin propagation algorithm (When magnetic field is set 'on', the central propagation
    routines also handle Larmor precession in the field) (p)
  - Handeling of analytical B-fields (p)

  Tools
  - New 'merge/convert' tool mcformat: Convert between McStas output formats and merge cluster
    node datasets into one dataset.
  - TOF mode for mcdisplay (Statistical chopper acceptance diagrams generated from the simulated
    neutron rays. Currently only supported on Unix systems with PGPLOT.)
  - Optmisation support in mcrun/mcgui using Perl::Amoeba (se description above)
  - POSIX threading on multi-core processors (BEWARE, performance is generally better using MPI)
  - mcgui: Note that if you experience crashes when starting/running GNOME/Gtk2 applications, 
    update your perl-Tk installation. Two ways to do this:
    1) Get the tarball from http://www.mcstas.org/download/Tk-804.027_gtk2_patch.tar.gz and
       install using 'perl Makefile.PL && make && make install'.
    2) Do a 'make tk' in the McStas unpacked McStas source directory. This will download and
       install the tarball into your McStas system directory.

  - PGPLOT and Scilab installation help tools on Linux systems

  WARNINGS (Almost identical to those from release 1.9.1)
  - Because of rapid changes in the support software for McStas, the current release has support
    for only some releases of:

    * Scilab (Win32 and Unix) - pick release 4.0 if available or pick release 3.0 from , e.g. from

      crashing, please install updated perl-Tk as noted above.

Changes in McStas v1.9, Nov 16, 2005

  General
  - To indicate the collaborative nature of the McStas package, the main website
    URL does no longer belong to Risoe or ILL but is http://www.mcstas.org.
  - The package has been strengthened by the presence of Klaus Lieutenant (former
    captain of Vitess, HMI) at ILL. He has focused a lot on validation and testing
    of the package, giving very important input and done very valuable work.
  - To help us in the fight against bugs, a BUGZILLA system has been set up for users
    to report their suggestions and problems. The system is available at the URL
    http://www.mcstas.org/McZilla .
  - The VnCS (Virtual neutron Code Sharing) agreement has been signed by the leaders
    of the Vitess and McStas software packages to formally support closer collaboration
    and sharing of code between the packages. At least one component (Vitess_ChopperFermi)
    now works with both packages, work done by Klaus Lieutenant and Geza Zsigmond.
  - Many big and small BUGS ellimnated!
  - First attempt at "concentric components" (sample environment). See Isotropic_Sqw in
    the 'Components' section below.

  Documentation
  - With this release, the component manual has finally been updated! Major work has
    been put into this by especially Kim Lefmann and Emmanuel Farhi. The user manual
    has also been revised, but not as intensively.
  - Improvements to tutorial/teaching material as result of Copenhagen University course on
    neutron scattering, given by Kim Lefmann and Peter Willendrup. The idea is that when
    improved further, the full simulation part of the course can serve as an extended
    tutorial for McStas. In the package, projects on virtual experiments at DMC, RITA-2 and
    SANS-2 at PSI is included.

  Tools
  - A web frontend is now available for McStas, check it out at http://www.mcstas.org/webfront .
    Currently it is not actually part of the package, may become so in a near future release.
  - On Unix systems, mcdaemon is a tool to periodically send -USR2 signals (save) to running
    simulation processes. Is in an early state but should work okay, but not documented in the
    user manual. Replots intermediate data.
  - mcgui has been intensively revised, many annoyances have been removed and features adjusted
    for easier use.

  Components
  - For simplicity, a number of components (especially monitors and sources) have been merged.
    This for example means that the Source_simple replaces the former Source_flat* components.
    Fewer duplications of code => smaller risk of old bugs surviving in the code.
  - PowderN: General powder sample component, replaces the simpler Powder1 and Powder2 components,
    has a very flexible system to read crystallographic data for powder line description. Is
    in the process of beeing validated against data from DMC@PSI. The code itself and the
    validation of it is the result of collaboration between mainly Peter Willendrup from the
    McStas team and Laurent Chapon (ISIS), Uwe Filges (PSI) and Lukas Keller (PSI). A validation
    paper will be presented at ICNS, Sydney.
  - Isotropic_Sqw: Originally work for the Ph.D. thesis of V. Hugouvieux, ILL. Extended and
    validated intensively by Emmanuel Farhi, ILL. It handles elastic and inelastic scattering
    for both coherent and incoherent processes, with secondary absorption and multiple scattering.
    The code has been validated against PowderN and V_sample. It comes with the same flexible
    system as PowderN to read data files, including crystallographic data for powder line
    description. Moreover, it may be used to describe concentric geometries in order to model
    sample environments.
  - Vitess_ChopperFermi: Originally work for Vitess by Geza Zsigmond, now PSI. Validated and
    adapted for use with McStas by Klaus Lieutentant, ILL in the frame of the VnCS agreement.
  - TOFRes_sample: time-of-flight version of the Res_sample component. Written by Kim Lefmann,
    Risoe. Will be merged with the res_sample component in next release.
  - The full suite of Fermi Choppers have been tested intensively by Klaus Lieutentant, partly
    inspired by the work of ILL stagiere Rebecca Peacock.

  WARNINGS
  - Because of rapid changes in the support software for McStas, the current release has support
    for only some releases of:

    * Scilab (Win32 and Unix) - pick release 3.0 from , e.g. from
      http://www.scilab.org/download/index_download.php?page=oldReleases.html

    * Perl (Win32) - on Windows we only support Perl 5.6 - pick
      http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/Windows/5.6/ActivePerl-5.6.1.638-MSWin32-x86.msi


Changes in McStas v1.8, Mar 4, 2004

  License
  - McStas is now GPL software. Note that generated code, output data and papers
    based on these is not considered "derived work" but merely normal usage of the
    software package.
  - The McStas software package now includes a re-distribution of the plotlib
    package for Scilab, (http://www.dma.utc.fr/~mottelet/myplot.html), courtesy of
    Stephane Mottelet (stephane.mottelet@dma.utc.fr). Plotlib is beeing distributed
    using a BSD like license. Plotlib needs not be precompiled anymore.
  - McStas now uses the Perl CPAN module Proc::Simple on unix platforms. Proc::Simple
    is distributed using the Perl artistic license.

  General
  - Nightly CVS builds of McStas are now available to the public from
    http://mcstas.risoe.dk/cvs (optionally use the mcsync script to get these)
    NOTE: The CVS builds are not considered 100% stable, you can count on errors
    in there, but you also get the newest stuff.

  Installation
  - Improved installation and build scripts. NOTE: The new version is INCOMPATIBLE
    with Win32 releases older than Windows 2000
  - Automatic detection of plotting backend, (make config)
  - Test procedure (make test)

  Kernel (i.e. the 'mcstas' program)
  - a PREVIOUS keyword has been implemented, for referencing e.g. position placement
    to upsteam components.
  - improvements to runtime randvec_target_rect functions
  - Updated Mersenne Twister random number generator

  Tools
  - Various bugfixes, especially on the Win32 platform and RedHat 9 specific stuff
  - mcgui now includes an option to 'scan' instrument parameters (previously only
    possible using mcrun.pl.
  - mcconvert.pl script has been added to the distribution, converts between
    Matlab and Scilab type output. Cyclic conversion, e.g. Matlab->Scilab->Matlab
    is not supported.
  - mcplot opens scan steps with Matlab/Scilab backends
  - mcrun now has support for Matlab/Scilab backends, built in test procedure
    (mcrun --test), poor man's grid computing - see the manual for information on
    how to use this.
  - mcdoc support for instrument headers, support for the built in tutorial
  - Improved tutorial built into the gui tools
  - editor, various improvements (line numbers etc.)

  Instruments
  - mcgui now has a special Neutron Site menu (auto generated) to allow distribution
    of instruments
  - instruments can now have default input values
  - several contributed / new instruments, have a look in your examples/ folder

  Components
  - New components:
    $ Official components
      - Sans_spheres, a sample for small angle neutron scattering
      - Powder2, a two ring powder sample
      - Phonon_simple, a phonon scattering sample
      - Guide_gravity improved
    $ Contributed components
      - Guide_tapering, guide with elliptical/parabolic/general tapering
        (Uwe Filges)
      - ISIS_moderator, (Stuart Ansell and Dickon Champion)
      - Guide_curved (Ross Stewart)

Changes in McStas v1.7, Jan 17, 2003

  Kernel (i.e. the 'mcstas' program)
  - components may have a SHARE section, which is imported only once per type
    of component. It has the same role as DECLARE, but only once.
  - the component files may have some %include inside '%{ }%' C DECLARE or SHARE
    blocks. The files to include are searched locally, and then in the library.
    If an extension is found, just the specified file is included, else both
    .h and .c are embedded if the --no-runtime has not been specified.
    The instrument files can also embed external files, both in C blocks
    and in the instrument parts (DECLARE, etc...) as in previous releases.
  - The instrument and components may have char* setting parameters. For
    instruments, their length is limited to 1024 chars.
  - The FINALLY section, that was executed at the end, has been split into
    still the FINALLY, and a new SAVE section. This latter is executed
    at simulation end (just before the FINALLY), but also each time an
    intermediate save is required (e.g. a 'kill -USR2 <pid>' is used).
  - An instrument source file may contain EXTEND %{ }% C blocks just after
    the usual AT...ROTATED.. keywords, to extend the behaviour of existing
    components, without touching their code. All local component variables are
    available. This may for instance be used to add a new 'color' to neutrons,
    i.e. assign a new characteristic variable to the neutron.
  - component instances in an instrument source file may be GROUPed into
    exclusive assembly, i.e. only one component of the group will intercept
    neutron, the rest will be skipped. This is usefull for multi monochromators
    multi detectors, multiple collimators, ... This is a kind if splitting.
  - McStas can now compile for Windows without troubles (if lex/yacc files
    were generated elsewere, or using the flex/yacc for Windows)

  Run-time library (e.g. the instrument program)
  - A global gravitation handling is now available, by setting the -g flag
  - many output formats are available for data. use the --format="format"
    flag, e.g. --format="Scilab". The full list is displayed with
    the -h flag for the instrument program.
    example:
      mcrun test.instr --format="Matlab binary" -n 1e4
    will create a mcstas.m file. Launch Matlab and execute
      s=mcstas('plot')  % will import data into s, and plot all detectors.
    Binary formats are handled by IDL, Matlab, Scilab.
    The present available format list is
      "McStas" "Scilab" "Matlab" "IDL" "XML" "HTML"
    The default format is McStas/PGPLOT, but may be specified globally using
    the MCSTAS_FORMAT environment variable
  - It is possible to save 3D data arrays, by calling the DETECTOR_OUT_3D macro.
    (handled as 2D by mcplot)
  - The type of the 'number of events' array in monitors was changed from int to
    double, to avoid overflow. Please update your home-made monitors.
  - many dedicated libraries are now available as shared code for reading
    tables, handling data trees and monitors. These are C functions to be
    %included into components (see e.g. lib/monitors/Monitor_nD.comp)
  - The USR2 signal generates an intermediate save for all monitors, during
    the simulation (execute the SAVE section). The USR1 still give informations.
  - a new randvec_target_rect function now focuses on a rectangle
    (more efficient than former randvec_target_sphere=randvec_target_circle)

  Components (in the lib directory)
  - a new data directory contains neutron data tables
  - obsolete directory contains components that were renamed or old.
  - misc/Progress_bar component now exists, and may save data regularly.
  - optics/Monochromator_curved can read reflectivity and transmission tables
  - monitors/Monitor_nD can have automatic limits mode for either all or
    selected monitored variables. It may also plot banana monitors for mcdisplay
    and trigger intermediate savings for all monitors (same as USR2 sig.)
    Also, it may monitor something else than the intensity, e.g. the mean
    energy on a XY psd.
  - sources/Virtual_output can save all neutron events into a file
    (beware the size of the generated files !). Format may be text and binary
  - sources/Virtual_input can read the files generated by Virtual_output
  - optics/Guide_gravity can handle a 2D array of channels
  - optics/Filter_gen can read a table from a file and affect the neutron beam
    (replaces the obsolete 'Flux_adapter'). It may act as a filter or a source
  - samples: they now can all target towards any component, giving its index
    (no need to compute target_x/y/z vector, use e.g. target_index=+1)
  - samples/Res_monitor, Powder1 and V_sample may now have a sphere or box
    shape, and may focus to a circular or rectangular area

  Tools
  - Matlab, Scilab and IDL may read directly McStas results if the simulation
    was executed with the --format="..." option (see 'Run-time' changes)
  - mcplot, mcdisplay, mcgui are now less dependent on the perl/pgplot installed
    versions.
  - mcplot can plot a single simulation data file
  - mcplot, mcresplot, mcdisplay can output gif, ps and ps color. They also
    have integrated help (-h options), and may generate output files in a
    non interactive mode (read file, create output file, exit)
  - mcplot and mcdisplay work with Matlab, PGPLOT and Scilab plotters (set with
    the MCSTAS_FORMAT default setting, or -pPLOTTER, or PGPLOT if not set)
  - mcrun can not currently generate scan results in other formats than McStas
  - mcsats2vitess works now ok for converting a McStas component to a Vitess one


Changes in McStas v1.6.1 (beta), Feb 18th, 2002.

 - a bug was corrected for very small signal statistics automatic limits
   search in Monitor_nD (0.16.4), that could cause parasitc peaks and
   fluctuations in detector.

 - 'optics' components were renamed by categories, starting with Guide_...,
   Monochromator_..., Filter_... etc so that sorting is easier.

 - Monochromator_2foc and Monochromator_curved can now read a reflectivity table
   file (eg. PG) with rows [k, R]. Both components give the same results, and
   can use the same parameters.

 - mcplot can now read a list of detector files, without a '.sim' file. This
   enables to visualise a set of selected monitors, or may be used when the
   mcstas.sim file was deleted. Detector files must be in current directory.

 - the 1D and 2D detectors now compute simple signal statistics (min, max, mean,
   center and width of distributions) which are stored in the detector file
   and shown in plots (mcplot).

 - The Virtual_input replaces the Source_file component (see below), and can
   read text, Vitess and binary float files of neutron events.

Changes in McStas v1.6-ill (alpha), October 29th, 2001.

 - In component definitions, a SHARE keyword followed by a C code block
   %{...}% acts the same as a DECLARE block, but is only included once in an
   instrument. This is very useful when using many identical components
   (guides, monitors, monochromators) to speed-up compiling and perfomrnaces.
     SHARE
     %{ /* included only once for all identical components */
     %}
     DECLARE
     %{ /* included for all components */
     %}
   Then all component programmers may add C functions to the 'kernel'. This is
   only worth when you plan to use a given component many times in a simulation
   (e.g. not for sources or samples). To downgrade a McStas 1.5 component, just
   move the SHARE block C code into the DECLARE block.
 - In an instrument definition, within the TRACE section, each COMPONENT
   instance may include a C code block:
     COMPONENT Comp1 = Guide(...)
     AT (...) ROTATED (...)
     EXTEND
     %{ /* some C code to execute after component Comp1 */
        /* in current coordinate system. You may use Comp1 and global */
        /* instrument variables */
     %}
   For instance, you can here give a 'color' (additional neutron
   characteristic) and modify next components behaviours.
   This block is always executed in groups, but you can test if the componnet
   intercepted the neutron with the SCATTERED variable (if (SCATTERED) { ... }).
 - In an instrument TRACE section, it is possible to put a set of component
   in an exclusive group. Only one of the elements of the group can act on
   the neutron. If no element acts on the neutron, it is absorbed.
   This is specially useful for multi-detectors, multi-monochromators in
   parallel, multiple collimators/guides (e.g. radial).
     COMPONENT Comp1 = Guide(...)
     AT (...) ROTATED (...) GROUP MyGroupName

     COMPONENT Comp2 = Guide(...)
     AT (...) ROTATED (...) GROUP MyGroupName
   Comp1 and Comp2 may even be at the same place.
   For programmers: it is important that the component TRACE section contains a
   SCATTER keyword when it successfully intercepts it, to tell McStas that a
   component in a group acts on a neutron, and can skip other comp in the group.
 - In 'mcplot', it is possible to use the -ps, -psc and -gif options to
   generate a PS, color PS, and GIF file, and exit mcplot (no display).
 - The Monitor_nD was upgraded to correct bugs when reaching the component
   (the propagation was not performed correctly in some cases), and the disk/
   sphere radius (monitor remained then squared). This component now uses
   the SHARE block. A bug was corrected for lists. It can output log and abs of
   signals, and source files (see Source_file).
 - The Gravity_guide now handles correctly the focusing multichannel guides.
   Gravitation is included (on y axis). This component now uses the SHARE block.
   The Channeled_guide does not handle properly the focusing multichannels.
 - The Source_gen component focuses uniformly on the target, and can model
   rectangular, disk, gaussian, and Maxwellian (up to 3 distributions) sources.
   Previous source components did not focus correctly on the target. They were
   also corrected, execpt the 'Source_Maxwell'. Source_gen can replace all thee
   previous sources.
 - A new Source_file component can take as input a text file containing an
   array with columns ' x y z vx vy vz t sx sy sz p', such as the data files
   generated from Monitor_nD with options="list all source". The source may
   be re-generated more than once, which is useful to improve accuracy,
   specially when further components do MC choices. Vitess files and float
   binary files are also ok (auto-recognition of format).
 - The signal handler now gives more info about where a signal was caught.
   For instance it tells in which component part an error occured, to make
   debuging easier.
   Usefull Signals: kill -Signal <pid>
      -USR1: display info and continue simulation
      -USR2: finish simulation and save results
      -QUIT: end simulation immediately
 - The 2D detectors now also output the errors/counts on signal as 1D detectors.
   Set p2=NULL in DETECTOR_OUT_2D to unactivate error saving in components.
 - We tried to lower the number of components by merging similar ones.
 - There are now new MACROS for the component programmer.
     * mccompcurindex is the number (index) of the current component
       (1 is first component of instrument)
     * RESTORE_NEUTRON(index, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, t, sx, sy, sz, p)
       restores the neutron state to the one at the input of the component
       'index'. To ignore a component effect, use
       RESTORE_NEUTRON(mccompcurindex, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, t, sx, sy, sz, p)
       at the end of its TRACE section, or in its EXTEND section.
       These neutron states are in the local component coordinate systems.
     * STORE_NEUTRON(index, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, t, sx, sy, sz, p)
       stores the current neutron state in the trace-history table, in local
       coordinate system. This is automatically done when entering each
       component of an instrument.
     * POS_A_COMP_INDEX(index) is the absolute position of component
       'index'. POS_A_COMP_INDEX(mccompcurindex) is the same as
       POS_A_CURRENT_COMP. You may use POS_A_COMP_INDEX(mccompcurindex+1) to
       make, for instance, your component access the position of the next
       component (this is usefull for automatic targeting).
     * SCATTERED is non zero when previous component acted on neutron (let pass
       or scatter)

   Warning: programmers, do not use anymore the 'mccompcurname' when writing
   your components. rather use the 'NAME_CURRENT_COMP'.

   Other minor modifications
   #cleaned up non used variables in mcstas-r.c/h
   #tested and corrected components
        misc: Vitess_input/output: included Spin from Vitess. (vitess-lib.c/h)
          but can not be used as mcstas can not find vitess-lib.c/h. I included
          what was needed in SHARE sections. now works OK.
        samples:
            Single_crystal (now can take lattice angles, forgot a %} at SHARE
              end)
            provide *.dat diffraction samples from Crystallographica
        optics:
            Beamstop now is a merging of Beamstop_circular and
              Beamstop_rectangular (using default  values to select shape)
            Channeled_guide: now output an error in multichannel focusing mode.
            Chopper: determined default values to have lambda~4 AA. Can handle
              First_Chopper (parameter IsFirst)
            Fermi_Chopper : default values for transmission every ~2 AA
            Gravity_guide: limit loops to max of 1000 bounces for each
              components (to avoid endless loops)
            Mosaic_anisotropic: can take DM (d-spacing). default for graphite.
            Powder_filter (did not work at all, now can take lattice angles,
              also works as a sample, can take samples/*.dat diffraction files)
            Selector: default values for transmission at ~4 AA
            Slit: now is a merging of Slit and Circular_slit (using default
              values to select shape)
            Soller: can take transmission
            V_selector: default values for transmission at ~4 AA
        sources
            Source_gen: can handle all previous sources in one component (up to
              3 Maxwellians). Corrected homogeneity bug for illumination.
            Source_file: can read 'source' files from Vitess, text files (both
              90 bytes/neutron) and float binary  files (e.g, from Monitor_nD
              with options="list all, source binary" which is more compact in
              size, 48  bytes/neutron). Autorecognition of the format. The MCNP
              output is not fixed. Just tell MCNP  guys to output the float
              binary or text file.

Changes in McStas v1.5, October, 10th, 2001

Modified components
      A corrected version of Arm.comp. For further information, see the emails by Ulrich
      Wildgruber and Stuart Rycroft. (Apr. 26, 2001)
      A corrected version of  Monitor_nD.comp. For further information, see the email by
      Emmanuel Farhi. (Apr. 26, 2001)
      A rewritten version of Gravity_guide.comp has been contributed by Emmanuel Farhi
      (see email). The component provided in the email works with McStas 1.4.2, but the official
      version of the component is not working with McStas 1.4.2 because support for this
      component has been added to the kernel. (Aug. 7, 2001)
      An updated version of Monitor_nD.comp has been contributed by Emmanuel Farhi (see
      first and second email). The new version of the component is not working with McStas
      1.4.2 because support for the component has been added to the kernel. (Aug. 8, 2001)
      Andrew Wildes and Emmanuel Farhi have detected an error when using focusing
      geometry in Channeled_guide. The slope of the channels is not computed corrected
      correctly, because the same left and right slopes are used in all channels. This has now
      been included properly in Gravity_guide, and it is recommended that this component is
      used. (Sep. 18, 2001)
      The handling of illumination in Source_flat, Source_div and Source_flat_lambda have
      been corrected. (Oct. 9, 2001)
  New components
      The He3_cell.comp has been contributed by Trefor Roberts. It models a cylindrical 3He
      spin filter cell. (Aug. 8, 2001)
      The Mon_2foc.comp has been contributed by Peter Link. It models a double bent
      monochromator with multiple slabs. (Aug. 9, 2001)
      The Bender.comp has been contributed by Philipp Bernhardt. It models a curved neutron
      guide. (Aug. 10, 2001)
      The Powder_filter.comp has been contributed by Ben Fortescue. It models a general
      box-shaped powder filter. (Aug. 16, 2001)
      The Source_Maxwell_3 component describes a source with three Maxwellian
      distributions. (Sep. 17, 2001)
      Various monitors have been added: EPSD_monitor, PSDcyl_monitor, PSDlin_monitor,
      TOF_cylPSD_monitor, TOFlog_mon. (Sep. 18, 2001)
          A minor error in TOF_cylPSD_monitor has been corrected. (Oct. 9, 2001)
      A new monitor TOFLambda_monitor has been added. (Oct. 9, 2001)
      A guide modeling waviness, Guide_wavy, has been added. (Oct. 9, 2001)
      A generic source, Source_gen, has been added. (Oct. 10, 2001)
  The signal handling system has been updated to handle a special case. The signal handling
  system will be documented in the manual of version 1.5. (Aug. 7, 2001)
  The representation of polarisation in McStas components and instruments is supposed to work
  as follows. Only components actually modifying the spin explicitly require the "POLARISATION
  PARAMETERS (sx,sy,sz)" line. An instrument handling polarisation may consist of  components
  both with and without this line; it will transform the spin vector correctly anyway. The
  "POLARISATION PARAMETERS (sx,sy,sz)" line is therefore removed from all official
  components not dealing with polarisation. The reason is that for instruments without polarisation
  some simulation time is gained by excluding the transformations of the spin vector. (Aug. 9,
  2001)
  Some definitions have been added that can be used in coding components:
      NAME_CURRENT_COMP gives the name of the current component as a string. (Aug.
      16, 2001)
      POS_A_CURRENT_COMP gives the absolute position of the current component. A
      component of the vector is referred to as POS_A_CURRENT_COMP.i where i is x, y or z.
      (Aug. 16, 2001)
      ROT_A_CURRENT_COMP and  ROT_R_CURRENT_COMP give the orientation of the
      current component as rotation matrices (absolute orientation and the orientation relative to
      the previous component, respectively). A component of  a rotation matrice is referred to
      as  ROT_A_CURRENT_COMP[m][n], where m and n are 0, 1, or 2. (Aug. 16, 2001)
      POS_A_COMP(comp) gives the absolute position of the component with the name
      comp. Note that comp is not given as a string. A component of the vector is referred to as
      POS_A_COMP(comp).i where i is x, y or z. (Aug. 16, 2001)
      ROT_A_COMP(comp) and ROT_R_COMP(comp)  give the orientation of the
      component comp as rotation matrices (absolute orientation and the orientation relative to
      its previous component, respectively). Note that comp is not given as a string. A
      component of  a rotation matrice is referred to as  ROT_A_COMP(comp)[m][n], where
      m and n are 0, 1, or 2. (Aug. 16, 2001)
