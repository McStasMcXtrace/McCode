The component \textbf{PSD\_monitor} resembles other monitors, e.g.
\textbf{TOF\_Monitor}, and also propagates the neutron ray to the detector
surface in the $(x,y)$-plane, where the detector window is set
by the $x$ and $y$ input coordinates.
The PSD monitor, though, is not sensitive to the arrival time
of the neutron ray, but rather to its position.
The rectangular monitor window, given by the $x$ and $y$
limits is divided into $n_x \times n_y$ pixels.

The output from \textbf{PSD\_monitor} is the integrated counts, $n, I, M_2$,
as well as
three two-dimensional arrays of counts: $n(x,y), I(x,y), M_2(x,y)$.
The arrays are written to a file, \verb+filename+, and can be read e.g. by the tool
\textbf{mcplot}, see the system manual.
