A simple source model, with a flat surface emitting photons. The surface in the
$xy$-plane is specified as a rectangle with dimensions
$x_{width}\times y_{height}$ m, or as a circle w radius,$r$. 
The initial xray position is chosen randomly in the source surface --- its
wavevector is chosen randomly (exactly as in the case of \verb+Source\_pt+ (section \ref{source_pt}) in the defining aperture with height $h$ and
width $w$ placed at $(0,0,dist)$. 

Just as for \verb+Source\_pt+ the aperture is for efficiency purposes and, if misused, may cause biasing

A spectrum file may be supplied as for \verb+Source\_pt+.

Currently only fully coherent or incoherent beams are supported. If $phase$ is set (and not $randomphase$ which takes precedence) a phase is set such that a photon emitted from $(x,y,0)$ will be in phass with a photon at $(0,0,0)$, which has the phase $phase$..
