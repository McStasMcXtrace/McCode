\textbf{Source\_lab} is a model of a laboratory X-ray tube. An electron ray hits a
target of specified material. Currently, only single material targets are
allowed. To model multiple material targets one could construct a model with two
or more sources simultaneously. This has consequences for intensity of the source which should be downscaled accordingly.

An electron beam of rectangular transverse crossection (\textit{width,height}) and energy \textit{E0}
impinges on the target of material. Wrt. the electron beam, the target is
considereded infinitely thick. The beam is considered to have uniform
intenisty. Thus, the spatial distribution of x-ray generation will be
exponential in the depth of the material.

Further, an exit aperture is defined with dimensions
(\textit{focus\_xw,focus\_yh}). The centre of the aperture is situated at a
distance \textit{dist} \si{m} from where the electron beam hits the target slab
at an elevation of \textit{take\_off} (see Figure~\ref{f:source_lab}).  

The \textbf{Source\_lab} coordinate system has its origin in the center of the
elctron beam at the surface of the
anode material and is oriented such that the z-axis points at the center of the
exit window, and the x-axis is parallel to the \emph{width} of the electron
beam. 

Note that the exit aperture is merely an opening. If the
material absorption of a window, e.g. Be, is to be taken into account a
\textbf{Filter} (section~\ref{s:filter}) should be inserted after the exit
aperture.

on the anode surface, and the coodrinate system is oriented such that the $\boldsymbol{z}$-axis point towards
the exit aperture.}

For each photon ray to be generated, a Monte Carlo choice is made to either
generate either a Bremsstrahlung photon or one from one of the x-ray emission
lines of the material. $1-\mathit{frac}$ of the rays are generated from characteristic
emission, and $\mathit{frac}$ from Bremsstrahlung. In most cases Bremsstrahlung is
unwanted background, which is why the default is $0.1$. Note that this
\emph{only} governs how much of the available statistics is diverted into
simulating Bremsstrahlung. It does not have an impact on what intensity is detected
in subsequent monitors --- only on the errorbars of the detected numbers.

The spectral characteristics of the generated Bremsstrahlung is goverened by
the model suggested by Kramer~\cite{kramers1923}. Although disputed in several
subsequent papers, the model is simple, and sufficiently accurate for many
background estimation purposes.

Characteristic emission on the other hand is sampled from a set of Lorentzian
functions with central wavelengths found in the work by \cite{bearden1967x} with
spectral widths taken from \cite{krause1979natural}.

An example of beam spectral characteristics emitted from a Cu-anode target
detected $1$ mm  from an exit aperture of $1\times 1$ \si{cm\squared} $10$ \si{cm} downstream from the
target at a \textit{take\_off}angle of $6\si{\degree}$ is seen in
figure~\ref{f:source_lab_spectrum}.
